"""Sonic (Game Gear) — gameplay drawing, decompiled.

This is the payoff of translating instead of byte-correlating: the level-map format
that resisted "guess the stride" reverse-engineering simply reads off the code.

gp_vdp_update ($0130) runs each gameplay frame. It pages banks 8/9 to stream new
tiles (tile_stream $31BC), then restores banks 1/2 and, if the camera moved, calls
scroll_draw to draw the newly-revealed map. The key fact the code makes obvious:
scroll_draw blits ONE pre-expanded 2x2 block (8 bytes = four name-table cells, each
tile+attr) from the pointer at $D2AF — it does not expand blocks itself, and with
bank 1 paged into slot 1 the block data lives in bank 1, name-table-ready. (So the
"layout" the map is read from is a stream of these 8-byte expanded blocks, which is
why no block-index stride reproduced the screen.)

    This is what answers "why every 8 px, not 16?": the engine doesn't step block by
    block. Each frame it nudges the drawn position toward the camera by at most one tile
    (8 px) — clamped to 8 unless a fine-scroll flag asks for 1 — and scroll_draw then
    blits the 2x2 block straddling the freshly-exposed tile edge. So the *draw cadence*
    is the 8-px catch-up step (tile resolution, capped to bound per-frame VRAM work),
    while the 16-px macro-block is just the *source unit* $D2AF points at. A given block
    is therefore touched at both of its tile edges — a small redundancy traded for not
    having to track block parity against the camera.

# this: with a real ground-heavy capture and the VRAM watchpoint, the true terrain draw
# turned out to be at bank 0 $0760/$0860, NOT scroll_draw $3282, which only draws
# OBJECTS. The pipeline:)
#
#   1. The block-index MAP is decompressed from bank 4 into a RAM WINDOW at $C000 at
#      level load ($09C9 pages bank 4, fills $C000). It is ROW-MAJOR, stride 256:
#         block_index = mem[$C000 + row*256 + col]
#      (the address routine $0938 picks the stride from $D232; default = 256.) Row is
#      vertical (0 = top sky, ~15 = bottom ground), col horizontal. Verified by
#      rendering it: sky on top, Green Hills surface terrain, solid ground below.
#   2. The expander $0760 reads the RAM map column, looks up each block's 4 tiles, and
#      writes the name-table cells into a column buffer at RAM $D180.
#   3. $0860 uploads the $D180 buffer to the VDP name table (OUTI) during vblank.
#   4. block_addr/$7B99 is the block-def table (8-byte name-table-ready 2x2 blocks).
#
# So the ROM map is the COMPRESSED source in bank 4; the live, decoded map is the
# row-major $C000 window streamed as you scroll — confirming the sparse design (sky is
# block 0 and dominates; trees/flowers/rings are objects, not blocks).
