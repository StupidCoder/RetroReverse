"""Sonic (Game Gear) — gameplay drawing, decompiled.

This is the payoff of translating instead of byte-correlating: the level-map format
that resisted "guess the stride" reverse-engineering simply reads off the code.

gp_vdp_update ($0130) runs each gameplay frame. It pages banks 8/9 to stream new
tiles (tile_stream $31BC), then restores banks 1/2 and, if the camera moved, calls
scroll_draw to draw the newly-revealed map. The key fact the code makes obvious:
scroll_draw blits ONE pre-expanded 2x2 block (8 bytes = four name-table cells, each
tile+attr) from the pointer at $D2AF — it does not expand blocks itself, and with
bank 1 paged into slot 1 the block data lives in bank 1, name-table-ready. (So the
"layout" the map is read from is a stream of these 8-byte expanded blocks, which is
why no block-index stride reproduced the screen.)

    """Move the 'drawn-up-to' X ($D254) toward the camera ($D3FF) by <= 8 px this frame.

    This is what answers "why every 8 px, not 16?": the engine doesn't step block by
    block. Each frame it nudges the drawn position toward the camera by at most one tile
    (8 px) — clamped to 8 unless a fine-scroll flag asks for 1 — and scroll_draw then
    blits the 2x2 block straddling the freshly-exposed tile edge. So the *draw cadence*
    is the 8-px catch-up step (tile resolution, capped to bound per-frame VRAM work),
    while the 16-px macro-block is just the *source unit* $D2AF points at. A given block
    is therefore touched at both of its tile edges — a small redundancy traded for not
    having to track block parity against the camera.
