# Sonic the Hedgehog (Game Gear) — cartridge format and game analysis

A reverse-engineering reference for `Sonic The Hedgehog (Japan, USA).gg`, the Sega
Game Gear release of Sonic the Hedgehog. This is the first Z80 / Sega title in this
repository — and the first cartridge ROM rather than a tape or disk — and the
writeup follows the same shape as the C64 and Amiga games, in reading order:

* **Part I** — the cartridge image: the flat ROM dump, the Game Gear's memory map,
  the bank-switching mapper, and the cartridge header;
* **Part II** — boot and initialization: the Z80 reset sequence, the VDP, RAM and
  mapper setup, and the path to the main loop;
* **Part III** — engine architecture: the main loop, interrupt handling, the RAM
  layout and how banked resources are reached;
* **Part IV** — graphics and data formats: the VDP tile/tilemap/palette/sprite
  encodings and the level and object data;
* **Part V** — game mechanics: Sonic's physics, the objects, the zones, scoring
  and progression.
* **Appendix** — toolchain and reproduction.

Methods: purely static analysis of the ROM image, plus the Z80 toolchain built for
it in the shared `tools/` module — the disassemblers (`tools/cmd/disz80`,
`tools/cmd/codetracez80`) over the `tools/z80` decoder. All addresses are Z80
addresses (16-bit, `$0000`–`$FFFF`) unless a *file offset* is called out; bytes are
8-bit. Parts I–II are complete and Part IV is under way; Parts III and V are stubbed.

# Part I — The cartridge image

A cartridge is the simplest image format in this repository. There is **no
container, no filesystem and no loader** — unlike the C64 tape (a pulse stream you
have to decode) or the Amiga disk (an AmigaDOS filesystem you have to walk). The
`.gg` file is a verbatim copy of the cartridge's mask-ROM chip: byte *N* of the
file is exactly the byte the Z80 reads from the chip at ROM offset *N*. So Part I
is short — there is nothing to *extract*. The only real structure is the **memory
map** the console imposes on those bytes (because the ROM is bigger than the CPU
can address at once) and a small **header** Sega stamps near the front.

## 1. The ROM dump

The image is **262,144 bytes = 256 KB = 2 Mbit**, an exact power of two. It carries
**no 512-byte copier header** (some circulating `.sms`/`.gg` dumps prepend one; this
one does not — the size is a clean power of two and the Sega header lands exactly at
its canonical offset, [§4](#4-the-cartridge-header-tmr-sega)). The exact copy this
analysis is based on is pinned by size and MD5 in the repository
[README](README.md#image-files).

That's the whole "format". Everything else in this part is about how the **console**
sees those 256 KB.

## 2. The Z80 address space and bank switching

The Game Gear's CPU is a Zilog Z80 with a **16-bit address bus**, so it can only
address **64 KB at a time**. The cartridge holds **256 KB**, four times that. The
ROM therefore cannot be mapped flat; it is divided into **16 banks of 16 KB**
(bank *b* = file offset `b × $4000`), and a small mapping circuit — the standard
**Sega memory mapper** — pages a chosen bank into one of three 16 KB *slots* in the
low 48 KB of the Z80's address space. The top 16 KB is the console's work RAM.

Which bank is visible in each slot is selected by writing the bank number to one of
four mapper registers, which live at the very top of the address space:

| Register | Effect |
|---|---|
| `$FFFC` | mapper control — cartridge-RAM enable / which RAM bank maps into slot 2 |
| `$FFFD` | bank number for **slot 0** (`$0000`–`$3FFF`) |
| `$FFFE` | bank number for **slot 1** (`$4000`–`$7FFF`) |
| `$FFFF` | bank number for **slot 2** (`$8000`–`$BFFF`) |

Those registers physically *are* the top four bytes of work RAM (the RAM is mirrored
into `$FFFC`–`$FFFF`), so a write both stores the byte and reprograms the mapper. At
reset the slots default to banks **0 / 1 / 2**, which is why the first 48 KB of the
ROM is the natural place for boot and core code. One important subtlety: the **first
1 KB (`$0000`–`$03FF`) is hard-wired to bank 0** and is *not* affected by `$FFFD`, so
the CPU vectors and the mapper-setup code below them are always reachable no matter
how slot 0 is paged.

For reverse engineering, this means a disassembler has to be told *which bank
configuration* it is looking at. The `tools/cmd/disz80` linear disassembler takes a
file offset and the Z80 address it is mapped to (`-off … -base …`), and
`tools/cmd/codetracez80` traces one ≤64 KB configuration at a time; following calls
*across* a bank switch is a higher-level concern handled when the code is analysed
(Part II onward).

## 3. The memory map

Putting the mapper together with the console's RAM and I/O, the Z80 sees:

| Z80 range | Size | Contents |
|---|---:|---|
| `$0000`–`$03FF` | 1 KB | ROM **bank 0, fixed** (CPU vectors; never paged) |
| `$0400`–`$3FFF` | 15 KB | ROM **slot 0** (bank from `$FFFD`, default bank 0) |
| `$4000`–`$7FFF` | 16 KB | ROM **slot 1** (bank from `$FFFE`, default bank 1) |
| `$8000`–`$BFFF` | 16 KB | ROM **slot 2** (bank from `$FFFF`, default bank 2) — or cartridge RAM |
| `$C000`–`$DFFF` | 8 KB | **work RAM** |
| `$E000`–`$FFFB` | ~8 KB | work-RAM **mirror** of `$C000`–`$DFFF` |
| `$FFFC`–`$FFFF` | 4 B | **mapper registers** (in the RAM mirror; see §2) |

The graphics and sound hardware is *not* in this memory map — the Z80 reaches the
VDP and the PSG through the **I/O ports** (`IN`/`OUT`), which is exactly what the
reset code does (`IN A,($7E)` reads the VDP V-counter; see §5 and Part II). The
ports relevant here:

| Port | Direction | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `$00`–`$06` | write | Game Gear registers (start button, **stereo** sound control, …) |
| `$3E` | write | memory-control (enable/disable I/O, BIOS, RAM, card, …) |
| `$3F` | write | I/O port control (joypad TH lines) |
| `$7E`/`$7F` | read/write | VDP **V-counter / H-counter** (read) and **PSG** (write) |
| `$BE` | read/write | VDP **data** port |
| `$BF` | read/write | VDP **control/status** port |

(The Game Gear's 8 KB of work RAM is the only general-purpose RAM; there are no
hardware sprites' worth of extra RAM — the VDP's 16 KB VRAM and 64-byte CRAM are
addressed indirectly through the VDP data/control ports, covered in Part IV.)

## 4. The cartridge header (`TMR SEGA`)

Sega stamps a 16-byte header into the ROM at **`$7FF0`** — the last 16 bytes of the
first 32 KB, i.e. the tail of bank 1, a region always present in slots 0–1 at boot.
(The hardware also allows it at `$1FF0` or `$3FF0` for smaller ROMs; a 256 KB ROM
uses the canonical `$7FF0`.) Its purpose on the original hardware is the Master
System / export BIOS region+checksum check; the Game Gear has no such BIOS gate, so
the field is informational here. The bytes in this ROM:

```
$7FF0: 54 4D 52 20 53 45 47 41   "TMR SEGA"   8-byte magic
$7FF8: 00 00                      reserved
$7FFA: 00 00                      checksum (LE word) = $0000  (unused on GG)
$7FFC: 08 24 00                   BCD product code + version
$7FFF: 60                         region (hi nibble) + ROM-size code (lo nibble)
```

Decoded:

| Field | Bytes | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Magic | `$7FF0`–`$7FF7` | `"TMR SEGA"` | identifies a Sega cartridge header |
| Checksum | `$7FFA`–`$7FFB` | `$0000` | left blank — the Game Gear never verifies it |
| Product code | `$7FFC`–`$7FFE` hi | BCD `…2408` | catalogue number (BCD digits, little-endian) |
| Version | `$7FFE` lo nibble | `0` | revision 0 |
| Region | `$7FFF` hi nibble | `6` | **Game Gear, export/international** |
| ROM size | `$7FFF` lo nibble | `0` | size code `$0` = **256 KB** — matches the file |

The region nibble distinguishes the platform/region the same way across all Sega
8-bit carts (`3` = SMS Japan, `4` = SMS Export, `5` = GG Japan, `6` = GG Export,
`7` = GG International); the `6` here is consistent with the "(Japan, USA)" dump
name. The ROM-size nibble (`$0` ⇒ 256 KB) agreeing with the actual 262,144-byte
file is a useful sanity check that the dump is whole and un-padded.

## 5. The CPU vectors

Because the first 1 KB is fixed to bank 0 (§2), the Z80's hard-wired entry points
all live at the bottom of the ROM and are always reachable. The Z80 has a fixed
reset address, eight one-byte `RST` call targets spaced 8 bytes apart, a maskable
interrupt vector and a non-maskable interrupt vector:

| Address | Vector | This ROM |
|---|---|---|
| `$0000` | **reset** (power-on / `RST $00`) | the boot sequence (below) |
| `$0008`–`$0030` | `RST $08`–`RST $30` call targets | the ones Sonic uses (`$18`/`$20`/`$28`) are each a `JP` to a common routine; the rest are unused/overlapped |
| `$0038` | **maskable interrupt** (`IM 1`) / `RST $38` | `JP $0073` (the VDP frame-interrupt handler) |
| `$0066` | **NMI** (the **Start/Pause** button) | the pause handler |

The reset code is the textbook Master System / Game Gear opening — disable
interrupts, select interrupt mode 1, busy-wait on the VDP until the raster reaches a
known line, then jump to the real initialization:

```
$0000  F3        DI               ; mask interrupts
$0001  ED 56     IM 1             ; mode 1 → INT vectors through $0038
$0003  DB 7E     IN A,($7E)       ; read the VDP V-counter
$0005  FE B0     CP $B0           ; reached scanline $B0?
$0007  20 FA     JR NZ,$0003      ; no → keep polling
$0009  C3 96 02  JP $0296         ; → main initialization (Part II)
```

The `RST` slots are a Z80 code-density trick: `RST $nn` is a **one-byte** call to a
fixed page-0 address, so the game routes its hottest common subroutines through them
(each vector is just a `JP` to the real code higher up). Recursive-descent tracing
from the three hardware entry points (`$0000`, `$0038`, `$0066`) confirms this —
`RST $38` alone has dozens of callers — and that is where Part II picks up, following
`JP $0296` into the initialization proper.

## 6. What's in each bank

§2 explained *how* banks are paged; this is *what* they hold, as far as the analysis
has reached. Banks 0, 3 and 8 are **traced** (Parts II / IV); the rest are
characterised here by content and by how the code pages them, and will be pinned down
as later parts trace them. Two cheap signals: the Shannon **entropy** of each 16 KB
bank (compressed data runs ~7 bits/byte, code and tables ~6, sparse data lower), and
whether the bank is paged with an **immediate** `LD A,n / LD ($FFFE/$FFFF),A` (a
fixed resource) or from a **variable** (which signals level-number-driven paging —
there are both in this ROM).

| Bank | File offset | Entropy | Role | Status |
|---:|---|---:|---|---|
| 0 | `$00000` | 6.85 | **main game code** — vectors, init, the VDP / load / maths routines | traced (Part II) |
| 1 | `$04000` | 6.72 | game code (the default slot-1 bank; the most-paged of all) | traced (called) |
| 2 | `$08000` | 6.43 | code / data (the default slot-2 bank) | paged ×9 |
| 3 | `$0C000` | 5.50 | the **`RST` dispatcher** — opens with a `JP` table (`C3 …`) | traced (Part II §2) |
| 4 | `$10000` | 5.96 | data (sparse, leading zeros) | inferred |
| 5 | `$14000` | 5.89 | data | inferred |
| 6 | `$18000` | 6.18 | a pointer / resource **table** (4-byte records) + data | inferred |
| 7 | `$1C000` | 6.23 | data | inferred |
| 8 | `$20000` | 5.58 | **graphics** — tile patterns + the palette pointer table (`$7400`) | traced (Part IV) |
| 9 | `$24000` | 7.01 | **compressed** graphics / data | inferred (high entropy) |
| 10 | `$28000` | 6.11 | compressed data — likely **zone / level** data | inferred |
| 11–15 | `$2C000`–`$3FFFF` | 6.2–6.5 | **zone / level data and graphics**, paged by level number | inferred |

So your intuition holds: bank 0 is the engine, banks 8–9 hold graphics, and the upper
banks (10–15) carry the bulk, high-entropy data the code reaches through *variable*
bank writes — exactly the shape of level/zone assets spread across the ROM. Tying each
upper bank to a specific zone is a Part IV/V job, once the level loader is traced.

# Part II — Boot and initialization

The reset code (Part I §5) ends with `JP $0296`. That is the real cold start: it
programs the cartridge mapper, clears RAM and sets the stack, brings the VDP up in
Mode 4, hides the sprites, runs a setup routine in another bank through the game's
banked-call gateway, and hands off to the main entry at `$1356`. This part walks
that path and the per-frame interrupt the init arms.

## 1. Cold-start init (`$0296`)

**Mapper.** First it re-asserts the default bank layout (Part I §2):

```
$0296  LD A,$80 / LD ($FFFC),A   ; mapper control ($80 = ROM mapping, no cart RAM)
$029B  LD A,$00 / LD ($FFFD),A   ; slot 0 <- bank 0
$02A0  LD A,$01 / LD ($FFFE),A   ; slot 1 <- bank 1
$02A5  LD A,$02 / LD ($FFFF),A   ; slot 2 <- bank 2
```

**RAM clear + stack.** The classic Z80 "fill by overlapping `LDIR`" — write one
zero, then copy it forward through itself:

```
$02AA  LD HL,$C000 / LD DE,$C001 / LD BC,$1FEF
$02B3  LD (HL),L                 ; (HL) = $00  (L is $00)
$02B4  LDIR                      ; propagate $00 across $C000..$DFEF
$02B6  LD SP,HL                  ; SP = $DFEF
```

It clears the 8 KB of work RAM up to `$DFEF`, stopping 16 bytes short of the top so
it does not clobber the mapper-register mirror at `$DFFC`–`$DFFF` (Part I §2), then
parks the stack at the top of the cleared region.

**VDP registers.** Eleven registers are written from a table at `$031C`, with a
shadow copy kept in RAM at `$D219` (the interrupt handler reads it back, §3):

```
$02B7  LD HL,$031C / LD DE,$D219     ; table, RAM shadow
$02BD  LD B,$0B / LD C,$8B           ; 11 registers
$02C1  loop: LD A,(HL) / LD (DE),A / INC HL / INC DE
             OUT ($BF),A             ; the value -> VDP control port $BF
             LD A,C / SUB B / OUT ($BF),A   ; ($8B-B) = $80|reg -> control port
             DJNZ loop
```

A VDP register write is two bytes to control port `$BF`: the value, then
`$80 | regnum`. The table (`26 A2 FF FF FF FF FF 00 00 00 FF`):

| Reg | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `$26` | Mode Control 1: **Mode 4**, hide the left 8-px column |
| 1 | `$A2` | Mode Control 2: display **off** (during init), frame interrupt **on**, 8×16 sprites |
| 2 | `$FF` | name-table base → `$3800` |
| 3, 4 | `$FF` | unused on this VDP |
| 5 | `$FF` | sprite-attribute-table base → `$3F00` |
| 6 | `$FF` | sprite-pattern base → `$2000` |
| 7 | `$00` | backdrop colour = palette entry 0 |
| 8, 9 | `$00` | horizontal / vertical scroll = 0 |
| 10 | `$FF` | line counter (line interrupt off) |

The display stays off here and is turned on later once the first screen is built;
the detailed register semantics are Part IV.

**Hide the sprites.** A VDP fill clears the Sprite Attribute Table:

```
$02CD  LD HL,$3F00 / LD BC,$0040 / LD A,$E0
$02D5  CALL $05F0
```

`$05F0` is the engine's **VDP fill** primitive — `fill(addr=HL, count=BC, byte=A)`:

```
$05F0  LD E,A
       LD A,L / OUT ($BF),A          ; VRAM address, low byte
       LD A,H / OR $40 / OUT ($BF),A ; address high | $40  ($40 = "write VRAM")
       loop: LD A,E / OUT ($BE),A    ; byte -> VDP data port $BE
             DEC BC / LD A,B / OR C / JR NZ
       RET
```

The high address byte is OR'd with the VDP's write-VRAM command (`$00` read VRAM,
`$40` write VRAM, `$80` write register, `$C0` write CRAM). Here it writes `$E0`
across the 64 bytes of the Sprite Attribute Table at `$3F00`, setting every sprite's
Y off-screen — **hiding all 64 sprites** before the display comes on.

**Handoff.**

```
$02D8  CALL $02F8       ; run a setup routine in bank 3 (§2)
$02DB  LD IY,$D200      ; IY = the game-state RAM block
$02DF  JP $1356         ; -> main entry (§4)
```

## 2. Cross-bank calls and the `RST` gateways

`$02F8` is one of three short **banked-call thunks** at the bottom of the home bank,
and they are exactly the `RST $18/$20/$28` vectors (Part I §5: `$0018 JP $02E2`,
`$0020 JP $02F8`, `$0028 JP $0309`). Each pages a fixed bank into slot 1, calls a
fixed entry in it, then restores the previous bank:

```
$02F8  DI
       LD A,$03 / LD ($FFFE),A       ; slot 1 <- bank 3
       CALL $4006                    ; call the bank-3 routine
       LD A,($D22F) / LD ($FFFE),A   ; slot 1 <- previous bank (shadow)
       EI
       RET
```

So a one-byte `RST $20` is a gateway into bank 3 at `$4006` (and `RST $18`→`$4012`,
`RST $28`→`$4015`); bank 3 holds a dispatcher the engine reaches through these
1-byte calls. The "previous bank" is read back from a RAM **shadow** at `$D22F`: the
game keeps `$D22F` = the current slot-1 bank and `$D230` = the current slot-2 bank so
banked calls can nest and restore correctly. (The banking/dispatch system is Part III.)

## 3. The frame-interrupt handler (`$0073`)

The `$0038` maskable-interrupt vector is `JP $0073` — the per-frame (vblank) handler
that drives timing once `EI` runs at the main entry:

```
$0073  DI / PUSH AF / PUSH HL / PUSH DE / PUSH BC
       IN A,($BF)               ; read VDP status — acknowledges the interrupt
       BIT 7,(IY+6) / JR Z,…    ; only do frame work when a game-state flag is set
       … VDP scroll + line-counter (reg 10 / $8A) setup …
       PUSH IX / PUSH IY
       LD HL,($D22F)            ; preserve the banked context across the IRQ
       …
```

Reading the VDP status port `$BF` is the interrupt acknowledge (it clears the
pending-interrupt flag). The handler is gated on a game-state bit (`IY+6` bit 7),
preserves the index registers and the bank shadows, and reprograms the VDP **line
counter** to fire a mid-frame line interrupt — the standard trick for a fixed status
bar above a scrolling playfield.

## 4. The main entry (`$1356`)

```
$1356  SET 0,(IY+0)                       ; arm the main game-state flag
       EI                                 ; interrupts on — the frame handler now runs
       LD A,$01 / LD ($FFFE),A / LD ($D22F),A   ; slot 1 <- bank 1 (+ shadow)
       LD A,$02 / LD ($FFFF),A / LD ($D230),A   ; slot 2 <- bank 2 (+ shadow)
       RES 0,(IY+2) / RES 1,(IY+2)
       CALL $0645 / CALL $1CD7 / CALL $0AA3     ; subsystem init
       LD A,$03 / LD ($D240),A                  ; game mode <- 3
       …
```

The handoff into the game proper: enable interrupts, set the bank shadows to the
running configuration, clear state flags, run the subsystem initializers, and set
the top-level **game-mode** variable `$D240` (the state-machine selector — title,
level, … — the subject of Part III). From here control is in the main loop.

### RAM landmarks established so far

| Address | Use |
|---|---|
| `$D200` | game-state block (the `IY` base; `IY+0/+2/+6` are flag bytes) |
| `$D219`… | shadow copy of VDP registers 0–10 |
| `$D22F` | current **slot-1** bank number (for banked-call restore) |
| `$D230` | current **slot-2** bank number |
| `$D240` | top-level **game mode** |

# Part III — Engine architecture

*Stub.* The main loop, the interrupt-driven frame timing, the work-RAM layout, and
how banked level/graphics resources are addressed.

# Part IV — Graphics and data formats

Graphics on the Game Gear are two layers of problem: the fixed **VDP hardware
formats** the data ends up in (§1), and the game-specific **compression** it is
stored under in the ROM (§2). With both decoded we can take a routine that loads a
screen and reproduce its pixels exactly — §3 does this for the first screen the
console shows, as an end-to-end check.

## 1. The VDP formats

These are standard Mode-4 hardware formats, decoded by the reusable
[`tools/gamegear`](tools/gamegear) package (so they are shared, not Sonic-specific):

- **Tiles** — 8×8 pixels, **4 bitplanes** (16 colours), **32 bytes** each, stored
  *row-interleaved*: each pixel row is 4 bytes (one per bitplane), and pixel *x*'s
  colour index is bit `7-x` of each plane (low plane = bit 0). `DecodeTile`.
- **Palette (CRAM)** — 32 entries of **2 bytes**, **12-bit** colour, 4 bits per
  channel in **BGR** order (`0000 BBBB GGGG RRRR`); a 4-bit channel scales to 8-bit
  by ×17. Indices 0–15 are the **background** palette, 16–31 the **sprite** palette.
  `Palette`.
- **Name table** — the 32×28 background map at VRAM `$3800`; each cell is a 2-byte
  word: the 9-bit tile number plus per-cell horizontal/vertical **flip**, **palette
  select** and **priority** bits. `DecodeNameEntry` / `RenderNameTable`.

## 2. The graphics decompressor

Almost all of Sonic's art is compressed (Part I §6: the upper banks run at ~7
bits/byte). The decompressor is the routine at **`$0406`**; it is a **4-byte-unit
LZ** — a literal/back-reference scheme whose unit is one *tile row* (4 bitplane
bytes), so a repeated row (a blank row, a flat fill) costs a single bit. It is a
game-specific *software* codec, so it lives in the game's
[`extract/decomp`](extract/decomp) module, not in `tools/gamegear`.

A compressed block is addressed as a `(bank, address)` pair; the routine's prologue
**normalises** it (`while addr ≥ $4000: addr -= $4000; bank++`) and maps two
consecutive banks into the slots, so a block may span banks. The block then is:

```
+0  word   (skipped)
+2  word1  offset to the match-info stream
+4  word2  offset to the literal stream (also the back-reference base)
+6  word3  count — number of 4-byte output units
+8  …      control bitmap: one bit per output unit
+word1     match-info stream: variable-length back-reference offsets
+word2     literal stream: 4-byte units
```

Decoding walks `count` units; for unit *i*, control bit *i* (`bitmap[i>>3] &
(1<<(i&7))`) selects:

- **0 — literal:** emit the next 4 bytes of the literal stream and advance it.
- **1 — match:** read an offset from the match-info stream — one byte `b`, but if
  `b ≥ $F0` it is a two-byte big value `((b-$F0)<<8) | next` — and emit the 4 bytes
  at `literal_base + offset×4` (a back-reference to an earlier unit).

So the literal stream is the set of distinct 4-byte tile rows in first-appearance
order, and the bitmap + match offsets reconstruct the full tile data from them.

## 3. First decompressed screen — the SEGA logo

The first thing the console shows is the **SEGA logo** screen, loaded by `$1CD7`
(`sega_logo`): it decompresses its background tiles from `(bank $0C, $FA74)` —
normalised to **bank 15**, file `$3FA74` — into VRAM, and uses background palette
index `$12`. Running the decompressor on that block yields a clean, self-consistent
result: `count = 1024` four-byte units = `4096` bytes = exactly **128 tiles**; the
palette resolves through the bank-8 table to a blue-on-white set. Decoding those
tiles with that palette ([`extract/cmd/titlegfx`](extract/cmd/titlegfx)) reproduces
the logo exactly:

![SEGA logo, decompressed from bank 15 and decoded with palette $12](rendered/sega.tiles.png)

This is the end-to-end proof that the `$0406` decompressor, the 4-bitplane tile
decode and the 12-bit palette are all correct against real data. **But note what it
is: the tile *set* (the patterns in VRAM order), not the composed *screen*.** They
coincide here only because the logo's tiles happen to sit in screen order. The logo's
name table is not stored at all — it is **built procedurally**: `$1E7C` points a
build buffer at RAM `$D000`, and `$1EC1`/`$2F07` place tiles into it from small layout
tables (e.g. `$1F27`, with `$FE`/`$FF` as skip/end markers) before it is DMA'd to
VRAM. So for this screen there is no tilemap block to load.

A true screen render — composing a real name table over the tiles with
`RenderNameTable` — wants a screen whose name table *is* stored or decompressed, and
that is what the **levels** provide (their map is decompressed to RAM and drawn by
`scroll_draw`). The fully general alternative, which gives the exact screen for any
case including procedurally-built ones like this logo, is to run the boot on a Z80
execution core and read back the actual VRAM — the "emulation as oracle" approach used
for the other games in this repository. That is §4.

## 4. The exact screen via emulation (the oracle)

Rather than reconstruct the logo's procedural name table by hand, we let the game
build it. [`tools/z80`](../../tools/z80) now has an **execution core** (`cpu.go`,
the runnable counterpart of the decoder) wired, in [`tools/gamegear`](../../tools/gamegear)
(`machine.go`), to a minimal Game Gear: 8 KB work RAM, the Sega cartridge mapper, and
just enough of the 315-5124 VDP to capture what the code draws (VRAM, CRAM, the
registers). It is not a cycle-accurate emulator and renders no pixels itself — it is
an *oracle*: it runs the real ROM so the boot decompresses tiles, programs CRAM and
builds the name table exactly as on hardware, then hands the VRAM back to be composed
by `RenderNameTable`.

[`extract/cmd/segascreen`](extract/cmd/segascreen) does this: it loads the cartridge,
runs ~60 frames (the logo is built progressively over several vblanks), reads the name
table from VRAM `$3800` and the palette from CRAM, and composes the screen. The logo
occupies name-table rows 9–14 (98 non-background cells over the `$70` fill) — the
**code-built tile map**, not a tile dump. Cropped to the Game Gear's 160×144 window:

![SEGA logo — the exact boot screen, composed from the live name table the boot code built in VRAM](rendered/sega.gg.png)

This differs from the §3 tile-set image in the way that matters: there the patterns
happened to sit in screen order, so the sheet *looked* like the screen by luck; here
the pixels are placed by the game's own name-table entries (each carrying its tile
number, palette select and flip bits), read back after the code ran. And because it
captures real VRAM, it is the reference any hand-written decoder is checked against.

## 5. The title screen (tracing forward)

The same oracle reaches the **title screen** with no new tooling — just more frames.
After the SEGA logo, the attract sequence runs on its own (the unmapped controller
ports read `$FF`, so nothing is "pressed"), and the title loads itself. Following the
boot frame by frame ([`extract/cmd/screentrace`](extract/cmd/screentrace), which
fingerprints VRAM each frame so palette fades don't hide the discrete screen loads)
gives a clean timeline:

| frame | name-table cells | what happened |
|------:|-----------------:|---------------|
| 6 | 0 | name table cleared to the `$70` fill |
| 9–47 | 6 → 98 | the SEGA logo draws in, row by row |
| 47–335 | 98 | logo holds, then its palette fades out |
| **335** | **767** | the **title** name table is loaded in one shot |
| 335–650 | 767 | the title's palette fades in; `PRESS START BUTTON` appears |

At ~650 frames the title is fully lit; `segascreen` now takes a frame count and an
output name, so `segascreen rom.gg out 650 title` composes it the same way as the logo:

![Sonic title screen — composed from the live name table at frame 650](rendered/title.gg.png)

Two things are worth recording. First, this screen is **767 background cells across
all 24 visible rows** — a full-screen image (Sonic, the banner, `PRESS START BUTTON`,
`© 1991 SEGA`), every pixel a background tile placed through the name table; the oracle
renders it whole. Its tiles are decompressed from the compressed bank (`$0406` called
with `A=9`, e.g. at `$190F`), confirming bank 9's role from Part I §6.

Second, a correction to earlier notes: **`$D240` is not the top-level "game mode".**
It holds `$0A` unchanged across this entire logo→title transition, and the
disassembly shows it used as a name-table scroll/row index (`$0E35`, `$4969`,
multiplied by 10) and as a frame countdown (`$472E`), not as a screen selector. The
attract progression is **timed/scripted**, not a single mode byte — mapping that
script is Part III's job; the oracle reaches the screens regardless.

*Still open.* The sprite (object) tile format, the level map format (decompressed to
RAM, drawn by `scroll_draw`), and the object data.

*Stub.* Sonic's movement and physics, the object/enemy system, the zones and act

# Appendix A — Toolchain and reproduction

Static analysis only, with the Z80 toolchain in the shared `tools/` module:

- [`tools/z80`](../../tools/z80) — a Z80 decoder (`Decode`/`Disassemble`) built on
  the CPU's regular x/y/z/p/q opcode bit-fields, covering the `CB`/`ED`/`DD`/`FD`
  prefix pages, plus an **execution core** (`cpu.go`) for running real code.
- [`tools/gamegear`](../../tools/gamegear) — the Game Gear hardware: the VDP tile,
  palette and name-table decoders, and a minimal `Machine` (RAM + Sega mapper + VDP
  ports) that drives the Z80 core as an emulation oracle (Part IV §4).
- [`tools/cmd/disz80`](../../tools/cmd/disz80) — linear disassembler over a file slice
  mapped at a Z80 address: `disz80 -off FILEOFF -len N -base ADDR rom.gg`.
- [`tools/cmd/codetracez80`](../../tools/cmd/codetracez80) — recursive-descent
  disassembler from given entry points: `codetracez80 -load 0 -entry 0000,0038,0066 rom.gg`.
- [`extract/cmd/segascreen`](extract/cmd/segascreen) — runs the boot on the oracle and
  composes an exact attract screen from the live VRAM: `segascreen rom.gg out [frames]
  [name]` (the SEGA logo by default, the title screen at `650 title`; Part IV §4–§5).
- [`extract/cmd/screentrace`](extract/cmd/screentrace) — fingerprints VRAM each frame
  to time the discrete screen loads through the attract sequence (Part IV §5).

Reproduce the boot listing in §5:

```sh
go run stupidcoder.com/tools/cmd/disz80 -off 0 -len 0x0C -base 0 \
    "Sonic (GG)/Sonic The Hedgehog (Japan, USA).gg"
