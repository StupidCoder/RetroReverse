# Elite (C64) — tape format, loader, and game analysis

A reverse-engineering reference for `Elite.tap` (the tape carries a single
autostarting file named "ELITE"). So far it covers the tape image and the
self-modifying copy-protection loader, with the game-program parts to follow,
in reading order:

* **Part I** — the TAP container and both tape encodings (standard KERNAL and
  the custom fastloader), enough to extract every byte from the raw image;
* **Part II** — the boot chain from the KERNAL autostart trick to the game's
  first instruction, including the self-modifying loader and its
  copy-protection tricks;
* *(Parts III onward — game program, graphics, mechanics — to come.)*
* **Appendices** — toolchain and reproduction.

Methods: purely static analysis of the image bytes — no external tools or
references, everything below was derived from the bytes in the image and
disassembly of the loader code it carries. Because the fastloader rewrites its
own wire format as it runs, the Go extraction toolchain (`extract/` plus the
shared `c64tools/`) does not reimplement the protocol; it *runs* the actual
loader on a small 6502 emulator and logs what it writes (Appendix A). All
addresses are C64 memory addresses.

# Part I — The tape image

## 1. TAP container

The image is a standard TAP v1 file. The TAP format stores the duration of
every pulse (time between falling edges) that the datasette would deliver to
the C64:

```
0000  43 36 34 2d 54 41 50 45 2d 52 41 57    "C64-TAPE-RAW"
000C  01                                     version 1
000D  00 00 00                               (padding)
0010  24 3b 0c 00                            payload size = $000C3B24 (801572)
0014  30 30 30 30 ...                        pulse data
```

* Each payload byte `n ≠ 0` is one pulse of `n × 8` clock cycles
  (PAL clock = 985248 Hz, so `$30` = 384 cycles ≈ 390 µs).
* In version 1, a `00` byte is an escape: the next three bytes are a
  little-endian pulse length in cycles. This image uses it for the silent
  gaps between files (e.g. `00 40 e1 0f` = 1,040,000 cycles ≈ 1.06 s).

Only five pulse widths matter on this tape:

| byte | cycles | used by |
|------|--------|------------------------------|
| `$30`| 384    | ROM format *short*, fastloader *0-bit* |
| `$42`| 528    | ROM format *medium* |
| `$56`| 688    | ROM format *long* |
| `$5D`| 744    | fastloader *1-bit* |
| `00 …`| ≥ 10⁶ | pauses between segments |

### Layout of this image

The pauses split the tape into 12 segments:

| seg | TAP offset | content |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| 0 | $000014 | CBM ROM format: header block for file "ELITE" |
| 1 | $008A49 | CBM ROM format: data block, boot code `$029F-$03C0` |
| 2 | $00CEA5 | turbo: vector patch, BASIC stub `$0801`, exit patch |
| 3 | $00DD25 | turbo (BASIC `LOAD` #1): game part `$4000-$86CC` |
| 4 | $042E7D | turbo (BASIC `LOAD` #2): multi-load routine `$CE0E-$CF40`, `$8609-$86CC` |
| 5 | $044B91 | turbo (kernal LOAD 1): colour data `$6000-$6400` → `$D800` |
| 6 | $0485EC | turbo (kernal LOAD 2): colour data `$6000-$6400` |
| 7 | $04C33E | turbo (kernal LOAD 3): bitmap loading picture `$4000-$6000` |
| 8 | $06378A | turbo (kernal LOAD 4): game part `$1D00-$3ECF` |
| 9 | $07BEFC | turbo (kernal LOAD 5): game part `$7300-$CA6D` |
| 10 | $0BBEB2 | turbo (kernal LOAD 6): colour data `$6000-$6400` |
| 11 | $0BFFD4 | turbo (kernal LOAD 7): `$4000-$41EA` + `$6000-$6400` |

## 2. Standard KERNAL encoding (boot file)

The first two segments are a normal CBM tape file, readable by the kernal
ROM loader:

* Bits are pairs of pulses: `(short,medium)` = 0, `(medium,short)` = 1.
* A byte frame is a `(long,medium)` marker, 8 data bit pairs LSB-first, and an
  odd-parity bit pair. `(long,short)` marks end-of-data.
* A block is: leader of short pulses, sync countdown `89 88 87 86 85 84 83 82
  81`, payload, XOR checksum; the block then repeats with countdown
  `09 08 … 01`.

Decoded header block (segment 0):

```
03 9F 02 C0 03 45 4C 49 54 45 20 20 ...
│  └──┬──┘ └──┬──┘ E  L  I  T  E
│  $029F   $03C0   filename (16 chars, space padded)
└─ type 3 = non-relocatable program
```

Segment 1 is the 289-byte program `$029F-$03C0` plus XOR checksum — the boot
code. Its load address is the whole trick that autostarts the loader; that and
the boot code itself are covered in Part II.

## 3. The fastloader encoding

From segment 2 on, the tape uses a custom turbo encoding. This section
describes the bytes on the tape; how the loader code that reads them is itself
patched mid-stream is Part II.

### Bit encoding — CIA timer as pulse discriminator

Two pulse widths encode bits: `$30` (384 cycles) = **0**, `$5D` (744 cycles) =
**1**. The threshold is implemented with CIA 2 timer A, latch `$0243` = 579
cycles: the loader restarts the timer on every edge, and if it underflowed
during the pulse, the pulse was "long". Cassette edges arrive on CIA 1's FLAG
line (ICR bit 4, `$DC0D`).

```
0334  LDA #$10                       getbit:
0336  BIT $DC0D                        wait for FLAG (tape edge)
0339  BEQ $0336
033B  LDA #$11
033D  STA $DD0E                        restart CIA2 timer A (latch $0243)
0340  LDA $DD0D                        read CIA2 ICR
0343  LSR A                            bit 0 (timer A underflow) → carry
0344  BIT $DC0D                        clear FLAG
0347  ROL $FC                          shift bit into $FC
0349  RTS

034A  LDX #$09                       getbyte:
034C  JSR $0334                        read 9 bits into $FC
034F  INC $D020                        (border flicker)
0352  DEX
0353  BNE $034C
0355  LDA $FC
0357  RTS
```

Latch setup at the loader entry point:

```
0378  LDA #$43  STA $DD04            timer A latch = $0243 = 579 cycles
037D  LDA #$02  STA $DD05            (between 384 and 744)
0382  LDY #$7F  STY $DD0D  STY $DC0D disable CIA interrupts
038A  LDA #$07  STA $01              tape motor on, ROMs in
```

### Byte framing, pilot and sync

A byte is **9 pulses: one start bit (always 1) followed by 8 data bits,
MSB first** (`ROL` into `$FC`; the ninth shift pushes the start bit out).
Raw TAP bytes:

```
pilot, repeated ~256 times (= byte $00):      5D 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30
sync byte $16 (1 00010110):                   5D 30 30 30 5D 30 5D 5D 30
```

Synchronisation (entry `$038E`):

1. shift bits into `$FC` (preset `$7F`) until 8 consecutive 0-bits arrive
   → guaranteed to happen only inside the pilot;
2. read byte frames while they decode to `$00`;
3. the first non-zero byte must be `$16`, otherwise restart at 1.

### Block format

After the sync byte comes a sequence of blocks, **back to back, with no
checksums and no gaps**:

```
end-hi  end-lo  start-hi  start-lo  data[end-start] ...next block...
```

Real example — the first frames after the very first `$16` (TAP offset
$00D7A5): header `03 34 03 00` = block `$0300-$0334`, followed by 52 data
bytes. The header is stored to `$AF,$AE,$AD,$AC` and the store loop is:

```
03A3  LDY #$03                       read 4 header bytes
03A5  JSR $034A
03A8  STA $00AC,Y                     Y=3..0 → $AF,$AE,$AD,$AC
03AB  DEY
03AC  BPL $03A5
03AE  JSR $034A                      data loop:
03B1  STA ($AC,X)                     store byte (X=0)
03B3  JSR $FCDB                       kernal: $AC/$AD++
03B6  JSR $FCD1                       kernal: compare with $AE/$AF
03B9  BCC $03AE                       until start == end
03BB  BCS $03A3                       then: next block header — forever!
```

Note the loop never terminates by itself: it always branches back for another
block header. That non-terminating loop is the hook the copy protection hangs
on — how the tape stops it (and rewrites the loader between blocks) is Part II.

Net data rate of the turbo format is ≈ 190 bytes/s (9 pulses × ~570 µs
average), roughly five times the effective rate of the ROM format with its
duplicated blocks. There is **no checksum** on any turbo data.

# Part II — Boot chain and loader internals

## 1. Autostart

The kernal saves the IRQ vector at `$029F/$02A0` while it uses the tape, and
**restores `$0314/$0315` from there when the load finishes**. The boot file
(segment 1) starts at `$029F` and its first two bytes are `A8 02`:

```
029F  A8 02            ← restored into $0314/$0315 = IRQ vector $02A8
```

So the first timer IRQ after "FOUND ELITE" jumps straight into the loaded
code at `$02A8` — no `RUN` needed, and the file also overwrites the BASIC
vector table at `$0300-$0333` on the way (it keeps almost all default values;
`$0314/$0315` inside the file is `2C F9` = `$F92C`, a kernal tape-IRQ routine,
so the machine survives the moment the vector table is overwritten *during*
the load).

## 2. Boot code (entry $02A8)

```
02A8  LDA #$20            fill $03C0-$07FF with spaces
02AE  STA ($AC),Y         ($AC/$AD = end-of-load address $03C0)
02B0  JSR $FCDB           kernal: increment $AC/$AD
...
02B9  LDA $FCD1,Y         fill $0800-$CFFF with kernal ROM garbage
...
02C7  LDA #$80  STA $9D   kernal messages off
02CB  STA $0800, STA $C6  zero BASIC start, clear keyboard buffer
02D2  JMP $0378           → fastloader
```

The jump to `$0378` enters the turbo loader described in Part I §3.

## 3. Self-modification — the loader rewrites itself from the tape

**Exit trick.** The block store loop (Part I §3) never terminates on its own.
To end a load, the tape simply sends a block whose address range covers the
loop itself, e.g. `$03BB-$03EB`. While that block loads, the byte at `$03BB`
changes from `B0` (`BCS`) to `A9` (`LDA #`), so when the block is complete the
loop *falls through* into the code that was just loaded:

```
03BB  A9 E6              was: BCS $03A3 — now falls through
03BD  LDA #$B0
03BF  STA $03BB          repair the BCS for the next use
03C2  ...                stage-specific exit code
```

**Protocol mutations.** Between payload blocks, the tape sends 1-3 byte
blocks aimed at single instructions of the loader, changing the wire format
on the fly (all values below were observed in the image):

| target | instruction | effect |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| `$0347` | `ROL $FC` ↔ `ROR $FC` (`$26`/`$66`) | bit order MSB-first ↔ LSB-first |
| `$034B` | `LDX #$09` operand → `$08`/`$0A` | bits per byte frame (8 = no start bit, 10 = two start bits) |
| `$03A4` | `LDY #$03` operand → `$04` | header grows to 5 bytes; the extra first byte lands in `$B0` and is never read — a decoy |
| `$03BB` | `BCS` opcode | exit trick, see above |
| `$0300-$0333` | vector table | rewritten over and over (ILOAD `$0330` → `$0378` keeps `LOAD` hijacked) |
| `$0350-$03C0` | whole loader tail | periodically re-written wholesale, sometimes byte-identical (a decoy — the stores race the executing loop and must match it) |

Because of the `ROR` flips, the *same* pilot/sync logic produces different
raw bit patterns in different phases: in LSB mode the sync byte `$16` appears
on tape as `01101000` (= `$68` read MSB-first). The pilot `$00` is a
palindrome and is unaffected.

The main payload of segment 3 (`$4000-$86CC`) is transmitted as ~70 blocks of
256 bytes, with patch blocks interleaved between almost every page —
extracting it without executing the patches is hopeless, which is clearly the
point: it is a copy-protection scheme, not just a fastloader.

## 4. Exit-code variants

Three kinds of exit blocks occur:

1. **Continue** (mid-segment): restore `BCS`, fix up some zero-page/vector
   values, `JMP $0378` — re-synchronise on the next pilot and keep loading.
2. **Return to BASIC** (end of segment 2): `JSR $FCCA` (motor off), set
   `$2D/$2E` = `$082C` (end of BASIC program), `JSR $A871`, `JMP $A7EA` —
   i.e. `RUN` the BASIC stub that was just loaded.
3. **RTS** (end of segments 3-11): set `$90` (STATUS) = `$40` (EOF),
   `CLC`, `RTS` — return as a well-behaved `ILOAD` implementation to the
   kernal `LOAD` caller.

## 5. The multi-stage load chain

```
kernal ROM load  →  boot "ELITE" $029F-$03C0 (autostart via IRQ vector $029F/$02A0)
$02A8 boot code  →  JMP $0378 fastloader
  seg 2:  vectors ($0330 ILOAD → $0378), BASIC stub $0801, exit → RUN
BASIC stub:      10 IF F=0 THEN F=1:LOAD
                 20 IF F=1 THEN F=2:LOAD
                 30 SYS 30215
  LOAD #1 (ILOAD = fastloader) → seg 3: game part $4000-$86CC
  LOAD #2                      → seg 4: $CE0E-$CF40, $8609-$86CC, patch $7604
SYS 30215 = $7607 → ... → JMP $CE0E:
  7 × JSR $FFD5 (kernal LOAD, still via ILOAD = $0378):
     seg 5  colours  $6000-$6400  → copied to colour RAM $D800
     seg 6  colours  $6000-$6400
     seg 7  bitmap   $4000-$6000  (loading picture, shown during...)
     seg 8  game     $1D00-$3ECF
     seg 9  game     $7300-$CA6D
     seg 10 colours  $6000-$6400  → copied to $D800
     seg 11 data     $4000-$41EA + $6000-$6400
  restore default vectors (table at $CF00, ILOAD back to $F4A5)
  JMP $1D1F  →  game starts
```

The BASIC-stub detour exists because a tape `LOAD` from inside a running
BASIC program restarts the program afterwards — the `F` flag variable makes
each line run once. The 5-byte headers, the bit-order flips and the no-op
rewrites have no functional purpose other than to frustrate exactly the kind
of analysis done here.

# Appendix A — Toolchain and reproduction

Because the wire format is rewritten on the fly by code that arrives on the
wire itself, the extractor does not reimplement the protocol. Instead it
**runs the actual loader** from the image. Most of the machinery is shared
with the other games in this repository via the `c64tools` module (see the
root `README.md`); only the Elite-specific glue lives in `extract/`:

1. `c64tools/tap` parses the TAP container into pulses.
2. `c64tools/cbmtape` decodes the ROM-format boot file (checksum verified).
3. `c64tools/mos6502` (CPU) and `c64tools/c64` (machine model) run the boot
   code on a small 6502 emulator. The only hardware modelled is what the
   loader touches: CIA1 FLAG edges fed from the TAP pulse stream, and CIA2
   timers A/B as pulse-width discriminators against their latches. The
   standard KERNAL tape entry points ($FCDB, $FCD1, $FCCA, $FF90) are
   provided by `c64tools/c64`; the Elite-specific hooks in `extract/driver.go`
   add KERNAL LOAD ($FFD5/ILOAD) and the BASIC statement loop $A7EA, which
   drives the loaded `LOAD`/`LOAD`/`SYS` stub.
4. `extract/main.go` logs every memory write performed while tape pulses are
   being consumed; contiguous runs are coalesced into blocks and written out
   as `.prg` files (one per contiguous region per tape segment), plus
   `memory_final.bin` (the full 64 KB RAM image at the end) and `report.txt`
   (every block in load order).

```
# Run from this game folder ("Elite (C64)/"). The go.work workspace at the
# repository root lets the extract module find the shared c64tools packages.

# 1. Summarise the tape (pulse histogram + segment map)
go run stupidcoder.com/c64tools/cmd/tapdump Elite.tap

# 2. Extract all program files by running the loader under emulation
( cd extract && go build -o extract . )
extract/extract -o extracted Elite.tap

# 3. Disassemble anything (shared tool, run by import path) — e.g. the
#    getbit/getbyte routines at $0334 inside the boot file
( cd extract && go run stupidcoder.com/c64tools/cmd/disprg -start 0334 -end 0358 \
    ../extracted/00_cbm_ELITE_029f.prg )

# run this module's tests
( cd extract && go test ./... )
```

The run consumes all 801,536 pulses of the image; the emulated game ends up
in its idle loop with the tape exhausted. Output files with `loader_` in their
name are the self-modification blocks aimed at `$0280-$03FF`; the rest are the
actual program data listed in the segment table in Part I §1.

Package overview — game-specific (`extract/`): `main.go` (write coalescing and
file output), `driver.go` (the BASIC-stub driver and Elite-specific KERNAL
hooks). Shared (`c64tools/`): `tap` (TAP container), `cbmtape` (ROM-loader
decoder), `mos6502` (disassembler + CPU emulator), `c64` (machine model),
`cmd/disprg`, `cmd/tapdump`.
