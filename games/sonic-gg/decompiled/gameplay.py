"""Sonic (Game Gear) — gameplay drawing, decompiled.

This is the payoff of translating instead of byte-correlating: the level-map format
that resisted "guess the stride" reverse-engineering simply reads off the code.

gp_vdp_update ($0130) runs each gameplay frame. It pages banks 8/9 to stream new
tiles (tile_stream $31BC), then restores banks 1/2 and, if the camera moved, calls
scroll_draw to draw the newly-revealed map. The key fact the code makes obvious:
scroll_draw blits ONE pre-expanded 2x2 block (8 bytes = four name-table cells, each
tile+attr) from the pointer at $D2AF — it does not expand blocks itself, and with
bank 1 paged into slot 1 the block data lives in bank 1, name-table-ready. (So the
"layout" the map is read from is a stream of these 8-byte expanded blocks, which is
why no block-index stride reproduced the screen.)

    This is what answers "why every 8 px, not 16?": the engine doesn't step block by
    block. Each frame it nudges the drawn position toward the camera by at most one tile
    (8 px) — clamped to 8 unless a fine-scroll flag asks for 1 — and scroll_draw then
    blits the 2x2 block straddling the freshly-exposed tile edge. So the *draw cadence*
    is the 8-px catch-up step (tile resolution, capped to bound per-frame VRAM work),
    while the 16-px macro-block is just the *source unit* $D2AF points at. A given block
    is therefore touched at both of its tile edges — a small redundancy traded for not
    having to track block parity against the camera.

# (Making the oracle scroll — hold Right+Jump so the player actually runs — unblocked
# this: with a real ground-heavy capture and the VRAM watchpoint, the true terrain draw
# turned out to be at bank 0 $0760/$0860, NOT scroll_draw $3282, which only draws
# OBJECTS. The pipeline:)
#
#   1. The block-index MAP is decompressed from bank 5 into a RAM WINDOW at $C000 at
#      level load, by the RLE codec $0A73 (caller $19D8 normalises the source bank).
#      Zone 0's source is bank 5, z80 $7430 (= file $17430), length $0786 (1926 bytes)
#      -> 4096 bytes = 16 rows x 256 cols (2.13x). It is ROW-MAJOR, stride 256:
#         block_index = mem[$C000 + row*256 + col]
#      (the address routine $0938 picks the stride from $D232; default = 256.) Row is
#      vertical (0 = top sky, ~15 = bottom ground), col horizontal. Verified BYTE-PERFECT:
#      decode the source straight from ROM (decomp.LoadMapRLE) and it equals the live
#      decompressor's $C000 output exactly (cmd/levelmap; rendered/level_map_codec.png).
#      (Earlier notes said "bank 4 / $09C9" — wrong: $09C9 is the full-screen draw, and
#      bank 4 $10000 holds a 4-byte-per-block table, not the map. The map is in bank 5.)
#   2. The expander $0760 turns each block index into a 4x4 grid of 8x8 TILES (= 32x32 px
#      per block). The block tile table is at bank 4 file $10000 (z80 $4000 read with
#      bank 4 in slot 1; the loader points $D249 at it, $0760's prologue $0726 pages it):
#         tile(r,c) = rom[$10000 + index*16 + r*4 + c]   (16 bytes/block, row-major 4 wide)
#      The index->table-offset math in $0760 looks scrambled (RLCA*4 / XOR) but works out
#      to exactly index*16. Per-block attr ($D211 table, $343D[zone]) yields only a
#      priority bit — no flip, no palette select — so all terrain uses the BG palette and
#      the pixels come purely from the tile index + the loaded tile set. The expanded
#      cells go to the column buffer at RAM $D180.
#   3. $0860 uploads the $D180 buffer to the VDP name table (OUTI) during vblank.
#   4. block_addr/$7B99 is the OBJECT block-def table (8-byte name-table-ready 2x2 blocks),
#      used by scroll_draw $3282 — distinct from the terrain tile table at $10000.

# FULL LEVEL RENDERED from ROM (rendered/level_greenhills_act1.png + _overview.png) via
# cmd/levelmap: ROM map ($0A73) -> 4x4 tiles ($10000) -> real tile set + palette = the
# whole Green Hills Act 1 (sky/clouds, palms, flowers, rings, checkered ground, pits).
#
# So the ROM map is the COMPRESSED source in bank 5; the live, decoded map is the
# row-major $C000 window streamed as you scroll. Most of it is sky (block 0) + ground
# (block 1) runs, but the SCENERY is baked into blocks too: the palm trees, flowers and
# ring graphics in the render all come from the block map (the render uses no object
# layer). The separate OBJECT layer is the interactive world — Sonic, enemies, and
