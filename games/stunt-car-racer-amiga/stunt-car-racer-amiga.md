# Stunt Car Racer (Amiga) — technical reference

**Image:** `Stunt Car Racer.adf` — 901,120 bytes, MD5 `b6d3751e6aa636f203f3c6a8de81ebfc`. Not committed (copyright); supply your own copy.

A technical reference for `Stunt Car Racer.adf`, the Amiga release of
Geoff Crammond's *Stunt Car Racer* (1989) — a filled/wireframe-vector stunt
racing game built around an unusually advanced (for its day) rigid-body car
simulation running on elevated 3-D circuits.

The writeup proceeds in reading order, but
the centre of gravity is the last two parts — the tracks and the physics:

* **Part I** — the disk image: the ADF container and the custom (non-AmigaDOS)
  on-disk format — enough to pull every byte off the disk;
* **Part II** — the boot chain: the boot block, the custom track loader it
  bootstraps, and how the game and its data load;
* **Part III** — the game program: the 68000 startup, the interrupt/Copper/
  blitter setup and the memory map;
* **Part IV** — **the tracks**: the vector format of the elevated circuits
  (the track sections, their 3-D geometry and connectivity) and a Go
  reimplementation that extracts and re-draws them;
* **Part V** — **the physics**: the car's rigid-body simulation — the chassis,
  suspension, wheel/ground contact, drive and damage model — reverse-engineered
  from the 68000 integrator and reimplemented in Go so a track can be *driven*.
* **Appendices** — toolchain and reproduction.

Methods: purely static analysis of the disk image, plus the 68000 toolchain in
the shared `tools/` module — the AmigaDOS reader (`tools/platform/amiga/adf`), the
disassemblers (`tools/cmd/dis68k`, `tools/cmd/codetrace68k`) and an
instruction-level 68000 execution core (`tools/cpu/m68k`) for dynamic verification.
All addresses are 68000 addresses; sizes are `.b`/`.w`/`.l` (8/16/32-bit).
**Status: complete. Parts I–III (disk format, loader, engine architecture), Part IV (the
track geometry — footprint, surface and camber, decoded and verified coordinate-exact) and
Part V (the full rigid-body car physics, verified frame-by-frame against the original) are
all done; combined, a car can be driven over the decoded tracks.**

# Part I — The disk image

## 1. The ADF container

`Stunt Car Racer.adf` is a raw, 901,120-byte Amiga floppy image — the usual
double-density layout of **80 cylinders × 2 heads × 11 sectors × 512 bytes**
(`80 × 2 × 11 × 512 = 901,120`). A byte offset on the disk maps linearly to a
sector: `sector = offset / 512`, with no interleave at the image level. Its
identity is pinned in the repository [README](../README.md#image-files) by size
and MD5 so the analysis stays reproducible.

The image opens with a boot block whose first four bytes are the ASCII tag
`DOS\0` (`44 4F 53 00`) — the standard "bootable AmigaDOS disk" magic — followed
by the boot-block checksum and the boot code:

```
000000  44 4F 53 00 30 AD 90 C0  00 00 03 70  ...   DOS. 0...  rootblk=$370(880)
                    └ checksum ┘  └ rootblk ┘
00000C  24 49 4F FA 03 F0 2C 78  00 04 4E AE  ...   ← 68000 boot code starts here
```

So at face value it looks like an ordinary AmigaDOS disk that boots Workbench.
It is not (§2): the `DOS\0` block is just enough to be *bootable*; the boot code
ignores any filesystem and pulls the game off the disk itself (Part II).

## 2. Not an AmigaDOS filesystem

The boot block names root block 880, but block 880 is **not** a valid AmigaDOS
root header (`tools/platform/amiga/cmd/adfdump` rejects it: *"root block is not a valid
root header"*). There is no DOS filesystem, no directory, no files — the disk is
**custom-formatted**: a flat region of game code and data that only the game's
own loader understands.

This is a common pattern for commercial
Amiga games of the era: a minimal DOS-looking boot block that bootstraps a
bespoke track-loading scheme, both to fit the data densely and to resist
copying. Everything past the boot block — the loader, the engine, the track
geometry and the physics tables — has to be located by following that loader
rather than by reading a filesystem.

---

# Part II — Boot chain and loader

## 1. The boot block

The boot code (from image offset `$0C`) is a compact, self-contained track
loader. It runs while the Kickstart still has the disk inserted, with `a1` =
the boot-time IO request (an `IOStdReq` on `trackdisk.device`) and `a6` =
`ExecBase`:

```
Forbid()                                  ; JSR -$84(a6) — stop multitasking
d0 = $9800 ; d1 = MEMF_CHIP|MEMF_CLEAR     ; ($10002)
a3 = AllocMem(d0, d1)                       ; JSR -$C6(a6) — 38 KB of cleared chip RAM
io_Data($28)   = a3                         ; read destination = the buffer
io_Length($24) = $9800                      ; 38912 bytes
io_Offset($2C) = $2C00                      ; source = disk offset $2C00 (sector 22)
io_Command($1C)= 2  (CMD_READ)
DoIO()                                      ; JSR -$1C8(a6) — read it in
... (retry on io_Error) ...
io_Command = 9 ; io_Length = 0 ; DoIO()    ; motor off
Permit()                                    ; JSR -$96(a6)
JMP (a3)                                    ; enter the loaded code
```

So the boot block **reads a 38 KB blob from disk offset `$2C00` into chip RAM
and jumps to it**. That blob is the game's real loader/engine bootstrap; the
boot block itself does nothing game-specific beyond fetching it. (The boot
block also carries a short ASCII string near offset `$76` — `Prot…` — likely a
title/copyright/"protection" tag; to be transcribed.)

## 2. The custom track loader

The `$9800`-byte blob (disk sectors 22–97) is position-independent 68000 code
(every reference is `LEA …(pc)`), so it disassembles cleanly with its file
offsets as addresses. It does four things:

1. **Take over the machine.** A `MOVE.l #handler,$80 ; TRAP #0` pair jumps into
   supervisor mode at `$10`, then it kills the OS environment: `INTENA`/`INTREQ`
   cleared (`#$7FFF → $DFF09A/$9C`), `DMACON = $7C5F` (bitplane/copper/blitter/
   sprite/disk DMA + master on), a level-3 (VBlank) autovector installed at `$6C`
   pointing to its own handler (`$13A`), then `INTENA = $C020` (master + VERTB).
2. **Load stage data to `$4000`.** With `a0 = $4000` and a return address in
   `a1`, it branches to the disk reader (`$D76`) to pull an initial chunk to
   `$4000`.
3. **Show the title screen.** It unpacks a 4-bitplane image from an embedded
   table (`$D9C`) into chip RAM at `$78000` — four interleaved planes `$1F3E`
   bytes apart, `$FA0` words each (a full lo-res screen) — loads the palette
   (`$D7C → $206`) and points a Copper list at the planes (`$4A2`).
4. **Stream the game and enter it.** The load loop calls the disk reader to read
   **805 sectors starting at sector 110 into `$E700`**, retrying on error (and
   flashing the screen red and hanging if it can't); then it sets the user stack
   (`usp = $7FFFC`), the supervisor stack (`$3D80`) and `JMP $E700` — the game.

**The disk reader (`$570`).** This is a logical-sector reader, not a filesystem.
Its arguments are `d1 = start sector`, `d2 = sector count`, `a0 = destination`
(plus mode bits in `d0`/`d3`). It validates `start + count ≤ $6E0` (1760 =
80 cyl × 2 heads × 11 sectors) and converts a logical sector to a physical track
with `sector / $B` (11 sectors per track-side), then MFM-reads whole tracks (the
helpers at `$C22`/`$664`/`$9E4`/`$746`). Crucially it **only reads** — there is
no decompression — so on disk the data is stored raw, sector-aligned. (A
`"DOW"`-plus-incrementing-byte table at `$96CE` looks like a per-sector
track/format key.)

### The disk map

Putting the boot block and loader together, the image is a handful of raw
regions read by sector — no filesystem, no packing:

| sectors | offset | bytes | loaded at | what |
|--------:|-------:|------:|----------:|------|
| 0 | `$0000` | 1024 | — | boot block (reads the loader, jumps to it) |
| 22–97 | `$2C00` | 38,912 | (chip) | the loader above |
| 110–914 | `$DC00` | 412,160 | `$E700` | **the whole game** (engine + tracks + physics) |

`extract/cmd/extract` slices these straight out of the `.adf`
(`extracted/loader.bin`, `extracted/game.bin`). Because nothing is compressed,
`extracted/game.bin` disassembles directly at base `$E700` — the input for
Parts III–V.

---

# Part III — Game program architecture

The game image (`game.bin`, `$E700`-based) is the 412 KB engine the loader streams
in. Its first bytes are not code that's reached by falling through — they are the
entry, a small trampoline, and an embedded Copper list — so the engine is best read
by following the three transfers out of the entry.

## 1. Entry, self-check and supervisor setup (`$E700`)

```
$E700  MOVEA.l #$E730,a0          ; a0 = start of the checksummed image
       MOVE.l  #$63BA8,d3         ; byte count ($63BA8 = 408 488)
$E70E  ADD.w   (a0)+,d0           ; 16-bit running sum over the whole image …
       SUBQ.l  #2,d3
       BNE     $E70E              ; … d0 = checksum
       MOVE.w  #$5834,d0          ; (expected value; a mismatch path exists)
$E730  MOVE.l  #$E73C,$80.l       ; install a TRAP #0 handler at vector $80…
       TRAP    #0                 ; … to drop into supervisor mode
$E73C  MOVEA.l #$EAD2,a7          ; set the supervisor stack
       JSR     $ED56              ; hardware init (below)
       JMP     $1BA08             ; main bootstrap (below)
```

So the image **checksums itself** ($63BA8 bytes summed as words), enters supervisor
mode through a self-installed `TRAP #0`, sets `a7`, and then does two things: the
hardware bring-up at `$ED56` and the game bootstrap at `$1BA08`. The bytes at
`$E74E` immediately after the trampoline are an **embedded Copper list** (bitplane
pointers `$078000…`, then the colour registers from `COLOR00` at `$180`), which
`$ED56` installs.

## 2. Hardware bring-up (`$ED56`)

`$ED56` is a textbook bare-metal Amiga take-over:

```
MOVE    #$2700,sr                 ; ints off, supervisor
MOVE.w  #$7FFF,$DFF09A / $DFF09C  ; INTENA / INTREQ: clear all
MOVE.w  #$E839,$DFF09A            ; INTENA = master|VERTB|… enable
MOVE.w  #$7CDF,$DFF096            ; DMACON  = master|bitplane|copper|blitter|sprite|disk|audio
MOVE.l  #$EEC8,$64 … #$F000,$7C   ; level-1…7 autovector table (handlers $EEC8/$EF0A/$EF1A/$EF5A/$EFC4/$EFF0/$F000)
…
MOVE.l  #$E74E,$DFF080            ; COP1LC = the embedded Copper list
MOVE.w  #$8380,$DFF096            ; DMACON: enable copper DMA
JSR     $EE8A                     ; CIA setup (timers/keyboard at $BFExxx/$BFDxxx)
;  ── anti-tamper ──
MOVEA.l #$F4B8,a0 ; MOVEA.l #$1AA4A,a2
EORI.b  #$80,(a0)+ ; CMPA.l a2,a0 ; BLT      ; XOR-$80 the range $F4B8..$1AA4A in place
JSR     $F402
RTS
```

Two details matter for the rest of the analysis:

* **The autovector table** at `$64..$7C` wires the seven 68000 interrupt levels to
  the engine's own handlers. The level-3 (VBlank, `$6C`) handler is `$EF1A`; the
  audio handler set lives alongside the sound-buffer pointers initialised just above
  (`$6A584/$6A588/$6A58C = $6A594` and `+$7D00`).
* **The XOR-`$80` decryptor** rewrites `$F4B8..$1AA4A` (≈ 46 KB) in place before the
  game runs. On disk that whole region is obfuscated, so a static disassembly of it
  is garbage until decrypted. `extract/cmd/extract` reproduces this pass and writes
  `extracted/game.dec.bin`; **all addresses in `$F4B8..$1AA4A` must be read from the
  decrypted image.** (Everything `≥ $1AA4A`, including the main bootstrap `$1BA08`
  and the top-level loop, is plaintext on disk.)

## 3. Game bootstrap and top-level loop (`$1BA08` → `$5C890`)

```
$1BA08 clear $EAD6[$80]                     ; small state table
       clear $7A01A..$7B6FA                 ; a screen / work region
       (conditional) fill palette at $E770
       JSR  $69CFC                          ; table init (per-entry loop over $6490…)
       JMP  $5C890                          ; top level
```

`$5C890` sets up the working screen and palette buffers and enters the game's outer
structure:

```
$5C890 MOVE.w #0,$23C32                     ; a mode/state word
       copy $1ECAA[256]  -> $7A91A          ; a 256-byte table (LUT)
       copy $5CF30[…]    -> $7A61A / $7A71A ; two parallel buffers (double-buffered colour/Copper)
       TST.b $64AF0 ; BNE …                 ; a "skip intro" flag
       JSR  $62D0A                          ; …
       BRA  $5C960                          ; the main loop body
```

From here the engine is a conventional VBlank-paced loop: a state word
(`$23C32`) selects the current screen (title / menu / track-select / race), the
double-buffered colour/Copper buffers (`$7A61A`/`$7A71A`) are swapped each frame,
and the level-3 handler (`$EF1A`) drives timing. The filled-vector race renderer,
the track interpreter (Part IV) and the car simulation (Part V) hang off the race
state of this loop.

*Memory map (run-time, so far):* engine code/data from `$E700`; the encrypted
`$F4B8..$1AA4A` block; sound buffers at `$6A594`; the working screen/Copper at
`$78000`+ and double-buffered colour tables at `$7A61A`/`$7A71A`; assorted state
words around `$23C32`/`$64AF0`. The track and physics tables are located in
Parts IV–V.

# Part IV — The tracks (vector circuits)

*The first goal.* Stunt Car Racer's circuits are short, elevated 3-D tracks
built from a sequence of **sections** — straights, banked curves, humps, jumps,
ramps and the collapsing "broken" bridge — each a piece of extruded ribbon
geometry with a height profile, joined end to end into a loop. The aim of this
part is to:

1. locate the track table on the disk and decode one section's format (its
   geometry: length, curvature, gradient/height, width, type flags, and how
   sections connect);
2. enumerate the game's built-in tracks (the league circuits);
3. reimplement the decoder in Go and **re-draw each circuit** (a 3-D wireframe/
   plan view).

## 1. Finding the track table (the race-setup path)

The selected track is a single byte, **`$1CA33`** (0–7), set from the track-select
menu and printed by the name-printer `$64C3E` (which does `ASL.b #4,d1` — names are
16-byte records at **`$1EDAA`**, in track order: *LITTLE RAMP, STEPPING STONES, HUMP
BACK, BIG RAMP, SKI JUMP, DRAW BRIDGE, HIGH JUMP, ROLLER COASTER*; the AI opponents
are a parallel 14-byte table at `$1ECAA`).

Starting a race runs `$5D2CA`: `MOVE.b $1CA33,d1` then a chain
`JSR $5AE46 / $64304 / $5A794 / $696FC / $65BEC / $604B4`. The first of these,
**`$5AE46`, is the track loader**, and it is the key to the data:

```
$5AE46 MOVE.b d1,d0 ; ASL.b #1,d0 ; MOVE.b d0,d2     ; d2 = track_id * 2 (word index)
       MOVEA.l #$1F0A2,a2                            ; the track-pointer table
       MOVE.w  $0(a2,d2.w),$1BCC0                    ; word = table[id]
       MOVE.w  $1BCC0,d0
       ROL.w   #8,d0                                 ; byte-swap the word
       SUBI.w  #$B100,d0 ; ANDI.l #$FFFF,d0          ; -> a 16-bit offset
       ADDI.l  #$1EF82,d0                            ; + data base
       MOVEA.l d0,a5                                 ; a5 = this track's data stream
       MOVE.w  #0,d5
       … reads bytes through $5AE00 …
```

So a **track-pointer table of eight words at `$1F0A2`** indexes into the track data:
each word is byte-swapped, less `$B100`, added to the base `$1EF82` to give the
track's absolute address. The reader **`$5AE00`** is a plain sequential byte fetch
(`MOVE.b $0(a5,d5.w),d0 ; ADDQ #1,d5`) — the track is a **byte stream**, decoded in
order, not a fixed-size struct.

Decoding the table gives the eight tracks, stored **contiguously in track order**:

| id | track | address | bytes |
|---:|-------|--------:|------:|
| 0 | LITTLE RAMP | `$1F8E4` | 124 |
| 1 | STEPPING STONES | `$1F960` | 145 |
| 2 | HUMP BACK | `$1F9F1` | 145 |
| 3 | BIG RAMP | `$1FA82` | 142 |
| 4 | SKI JUMP | `$1FB10` | 145 |
| 5 | DRAW BRIDGE | `$1FBA1` | 213 |
| 6 | HIGH JUMP | `$1FC76` | 142 |
| 7 | ROLLER COASTER | `$1FD04` | 312 |

`extract/cmd/tracks` reimplements the `$5AE46` pointer math and writes the eight
raw streams to `extracted/tracks/<id>_<name>.bin` — the input for the format work.

## 2. The record header

Each track stream begins with a short parameter header that `$5AE46` reads first
(five bytes into `$1CA19[1..5]`, then two more into `$1BBF6..9`). The first eight
bytes of all eight tracks share a clear shape — **byte 1 always equals byte 2**:

```
LITTLE RAMP     2c 0f 0f | 25 00 05 a0 cf …
STEPPING STONES 38 2a 2a | 0e 00 0f a0 cf …
HUMP BACK       35 2e 2e | 13 40 05 60 04 …
BIG RAMP        2c 01 01 | 18 80 07 a0 c0 …
SKI JUMP        28 0f 0f | 23 40 6a aa bd …
DRAW BRIDGE     4e 2a 2a | 04 a0 11 a0 cc …
HIGH JUMP       34 1d 1d | 04 40 06 20 3f …
ROLLER COASTER  4e 00 00 | 25 00 05 a0 cf …
```

`$5AE46` reads these into `$1CA1A..$1CA1E`, which fixes their meaning:

* **byte 0 = section count** (`$1CA1A`) — the loop below runs until the section
  index reaches it. Per track: 44, 56, 53, 44, 40, 78, 52, 78 — i.e. each circuit
  is 40–78 sections long;
* **byte 1 = byte 2 = the finish/start section index** (`$1CA1B`/`$1CA1C`) — a
  duplicated value, used to wrap the lap (`$5B10C`: start from `$1CA1C+1`);
* **bytes 3–4 = the initial position seed** (`$1CA1D`/`$1CA1E`; `$1CA1E` is later
  overwritten with the total track length).

`extract/cmd/tracks` prints all of this (`sections=… finishIdx=…(dup=true) seed=…`).

## 3. The section stream (RLE) and the spine builder

After the header, the body of `$5AE46` (`$5AED0..$5B106`) walks the byte stream once,
emitting one **section** per iteration into a set of parallel arrays indexed by the
section number `d1`:

| array | per-section meaning |
|-------|---------------------|
| `$1C5EC[]` | type / flags byte |
| `$1C588[]` | parameter 1 |
| `$1C4C0[]` | parameter 2 |
| `$1C524[]` | combined attribute (`param & $7F | $1BB1B`) |
| `$1C650[]` / `$1C718[]` (word) | the section node's **X / Z** coordinate |
| `$1C7E0[]` (word) | accumulated distance along the track (`<<5`) |

**Encoding.** Each section normally costs a type byte plus 1–2 parameter bytes. Two
mechanisms compress the common case of many similar sections in a row:

* **Run-length.** If a type byte's **low nibble is `$F`**, its high nibble is a
  *run count* (`$1BB48`): the following `n` sections repeat the saved type
  (`$1BC55`) with their parameter stepped by the delta helper `$5AE0C` — which adds
  or subtracts either `$10` or `$1` depending on flag bits in `$1BB1A`. This is what
  encodes a constant curve or a constant gradient as one marker plus a step.
* **Type-nibble ≥ `$C`.** These section types take their second parameter from the
  small tables `$5B2B8`/`$5B2BA` instead of from the stream (the standard ramp/jump
  piece shapes).

**Spine layout.** As it emits each section, the loop also places it in 3-D. The
running position is `(X,Z) = ($1BBF6,$1BBF8)`, advanced per section by a helper
`$5B2D2`/`$5B2C8` that — notably — **reuses the very same handle-decode formula as
the track-pointer table** (`ROL.w #8`, `−$B100`, `+$1EF82` on a 16-bit handle in
`$1BC8C`) to follow a *section-shape* sub-table inside the track data, indexed by the
section type. So section "types" are references to reusable extruded-piece shapes,
and the per-section dx/dz come from those shape profiles rather than from a sine
table. The node coordinates are stored in `$1C650[]`/`$1C718[]`; the cumulative
distance in `$1C7E0[]`; and the grand total length in `$1CA1E` (`$1BC2A << 5`).

**Trailer.** After the sections, the stream carries a fixed 6-byte block (`$1CA2A`),
then two optional object lists guarded by counts: `$1CA2E` pairs into
`$1C8A8[]`/`$1C8C8[]` and `$1CA2F` entries into a further array — the trackside
scenery / markers.

So a track decodes to: *a header (count, finish index, seed) → an RLE section stream
→ a scenery trailer*, with each section a `(type, p1, p2)` triple where the type
indexes a shared piece-shape table that supplies the geometry.

## 4. A verified Go decoder

`extract/cmd/sections` reimplements the `$5AED0..$5B106` loop exactly — the
run-length marker, the `$5AE0C` delta step, the `≥$C` table branch and the
`bit5`/`bit6`/`bit7` flag-driven reads — and then checks itself against the data.
The whole track stream is:

```
6 (header)  +  section stream  +  6 (trailer)  +  2*trailer[4] + trailer[5] (scenery)
```

so a correct parse must consume a track's bytes **exactly**. It does, for all seven
length-bounded tracks:

```
LITTLE RAMP     44 sections  used 124/124   STEPPING STONES 56  145/145
HUMP BACK       53 sections  used 145/145   BIG RAMP        44  142/142
SKI JUMP        40 sections  used 145/145   DRAW BRIDGE     78  213/213
HIGH JUMP       52 sections  used 142/142   ROLLER COASTER  78  used 192 (last)
```

(ROLLER COASTER, the last record, is 192 bytes — the raw slice in `cmd/tracks` runs
on into padding; the parser gives its true length.) The byte-exact match across every
track confirms the read pattern is right. As a spot check, LITTLE RAMP's first ten
sections are a single `$A0` run: a fresh `type $A0, p1 $CF, p2 $6A` section, then one
marker byte `$9F` (run = 9) followed by nine `p2` bytes, with `p1` stepping `−$10`
each section — exactly the bytes on disk.

What remains for the circuits is geometric, not structural — covered in §5.

## 5. The spine geometry, and re-drawing the circuits

The section loop also lays the track out in plan view as it parses. Per section,
given its decoded `(type, p1, p2, attr)`, the per-section setup `$5FE56`/`$5FEFA`
resolves the geometry from three data tables — all reached by the same
byte-swap/`−$B100`/`+$1EF82` handle decode as the track-pointer table:

* **`$1EF82 + ((type & $F) << 8)`** → a per-type *piece-shape* table. Its layout
  yields the section's **segment length** (`$1BB6A = $1BB97/2 − 1`, where
  `$1BB97 = shape[shape[0]]`) and related step counts.
* **`$1EFA2[p2*2]`** → the **X-offset shape** handle (`$1BC8C`); **`$1EFA2[attr*2]`**
  → the **Z-offset shape** handle (`$1BC90`). `p2` also sets the sign mode `$1BB79`.

The shape readers `$5B2D2` (X) and `$5B2C8` (Z) return the piece's offset at a given
distance along it, and the loop walks the spine by

```
node.X = cur.X − shapeX(0) ;  cur.X = node.X + shapeX(len)
node.Z = cur.Z − shapeZ(0) ;  cur.Z = node.Z + shapeZ(len)
```

storing each node in `$1C650[]` (X) / `$1C718[]` (Z) and accumulating the heading in
`$1BC2A`. So a straight piece (where `p2 == attr`, common in the runs) advances X and
Z equally — the world axes are the 45°-rotated `(x±z)` pair — and curves bend them
apart.

**The Go reimplementation (`extract/track`).** `package track` walks this spine
purely in Go, reading only the game's data tables — it does *not* run any 68000 code.
The handle math has two byte-width subtleties worth recording (the format is shared
with the 6502/Z80 ports and so cannot depend on any 68000 quirk):

* the per-type shape table is a **word table at `$1EF82 + nib*2`** — no shift (the
  `ASL.l #7` that reads out adjacent is the low word of the preceding
  `MOVEA.l #$1EF82`, not an instruction);
* the X/Z offset-shape handle index is `ASL.b #1` on the param, i.e.
  **`(param*2) & $FF`** — a byte multiply that wraps, not a 16-bit one.

`extract/cmd/spineoracle` executes the real `$5AE46` on the `tools/cpu/m68k` core (it
takes only `d1` = track id and self-initialises) and reads the `$1C650`/`$1C718`
arrays back out; `extract/cmd/spineverify` checks `package track` against it.
**All eight tracks match coordinate-exact** — the Go decoder is the source of truth,
the oracle only confirms it.

**These arrays are not (yet) the world centre-line.** Plotted directly, `$1C650`/
`$1C718` form thin slivers (plan aspect 6:1 to 23:1 — Ski Jump is almost a straight
line), which are *not* the shapes of the real circuits. Tracing the renderer shows
why: the per-section vertex builder `$5C0AA` returns `shape_offset + $1BC0E/$1BC10`,
where `$1BC0E/$1BC10` are exactly `$1C650[i]`/`$1C718[i]` — so these arrays are the
section *base positions*, but the renderer (`$5A1A6`) also reads **two** offset shapes
per vertex (`a4` from `p2`, `a5` from `attr`, alternating), and rotates everything by a
per-section **heading** (`$1BBF2 = $1BC30 − $1BC4A`, with `$1BC4A = type & $C0` the
section's quadrant and `p1` the intra-quadrant fine direction via `$5FF94`). Strong
evidence that one of `$1C650`/`$1C718` is the **vertical** (the `a4`/`a5` pair reads as
horizontal/vertical cross-sections), so the raw plot is closer to a side profile than
a plan.

So `$1C650/$1C718` are per-piece *extents*, not the plan. The plan footprint is held
elsewhere — and reading the renderer, not guessing, finds it (§6).

## 6. The plan footprint (the 16×16 track grid)

The engine renders the track by walking from the player's section outward, and to find
the next section it consults a lookup table. `$5FE04` is that lookup: it forms a byte
index `(y << 4) | x` from a grid coordinate and reads the **256-entry table `$1C280`**,
returning the section sitting in that cell (or `$FF` for empty). That table is built by
`$64304`:

```
for each section i:  $1C280[ p1[i] ] = i        ; p1 indexes the 16×16 grid
```

So **`p1` is the section's cell on a 16×16 grid** — its low nibble the grid X, its high
nibble the grid Y. That is the track's plan footprint, read straight from the data:

```
node[i].planX = p1 & $0F
node[i].planY = p1 >> 4
```

No heading accumulation, no quadrant transforms, no fitting — and it is unambiguous:
**every consecutive section is an adjacent grid cell** (0 non-adjacent steps across all
eight tracks), so the plans are smooth closed loops with no sharp corners and no
spurious self-crossings. The footprints are the real circuits — *Little Ramp* a
diamond, *Stepping Stones* a rectangle, and *Draw Bridge* a loop with the two inner
prongs that are literally its drawbridge:

```
.##..........##.        .##....########.
#..#........#..#        #..#..#........#
#..#........#..#        #..#..#........#   Roller Coaster (right):
#..#........S..#        #..#..#........S   an outer lap with an

#..............#        #..............#
.##############.        .##############.
  Draw Bridge             Roller Coaster
```

`package track` sets `PlanX/PlanY` from `p1`; `cmd/trackjson` exports them; the viewer
draws them.

## 7. Banking and elevation

The game's pre-race **preview** (the "steer to rotate view" screen) draws each circuit
as an *elevated ribbon on support columns*, which makes the two vertical quantities
plain: the ribbon **banks** on the curves, and it **rises and falls** (the ramps, the
Roller-Coaster hills) on columns of varying height. Both come, cleanly, from the
loader's two per-section extent arrays.

Tracing the two vertex builders settles which is which:

* `$5C6C4` reads the section's per-type **piece-shape** and rotates *both* its
  components by the section's orientation (its four quadrant cases are a 2-D rotation).
  A quantity that rotates with heading is **in-plane** — so this builds the plan
  footprint, not the height.
* `$5C0AA` reads the two extent arrays `$1C650` (from `p2`) and `$1C718` (from `attr`),
  adds them **un-rotated** (and `>>5`), and *those* are the heights of the ribbon's
  **left and right rails** — a vertical doesn't turn with the heading.

So the two rail heights give both quantities directly:

```
elevation = ($1C650 + $1C718) / 2      (the surface height)
banking   =  $1C650 − $1C718           (the camber: rail-height difference)
```

On a straight the section's `p2 == attr`, the two rails are level, banking is zero;
on a curve they diverge and the road tilts. The elevation profile **matches the
preview screenshots**: Big Ramp is flat with a single ramp, Stepping Stones gently
undulates, Roller Coaster is a run of hills — and every circuit's height **closes**
over the lap (Hump Back exactly).

**Smooth or stepped — solved, exactly.** A long search for an explicit "step here" flag
(`$65D3C`, the `type` bits, the `p2` sign, `attr`, `a0[1]`, the height magnitude) found
nothing — *because there is no such flag*. The surface is not one height per section at
all. `$5C0AA` is a **per-rung** builder: it is called for vertex index `d1 = 0,1,2,…`
across the section, and each call adds the section's base accumulator (`$1C650` for the
left rail, `$1C718` for the right) to a **profile value** read from the `p2`/`attr`
cross-section shape, then `>>5`. So every section carries a short array of rail heights
*along its length* — the in-game surface itself:

```
rung count   = shape[shape[0]] of the per-TYPE piece-shape   ($1BB97; counts both rails)
left rail[k]  = ($1C650 + a4-profile[k]) >> 5                  (even vertex 2k,  a4 from p2)
right rail[k] = ($1C718 + a5-profile[k]) >> 5                  (odd  vertex 2k+1, a5 from attr)
read mode     = nibble-packed if p2 ≥ 0, two bytes/entry if p2 < 0   ($1BB79)
```

The step-vs-slope distinction is simply **what those profile values do**. A smooth run is
a drivable slope; a sudden jump in consecutive rungs is a hard edge. Big Ramp's takeoff
section reads `[80 85 90 95 100 105 110 115 35]` — a clean climb to the lip (115) then a
hard drop into the gap (35); the next piece resumes at 35 and the landing ramp rises again
`[35 105 100 …]`. That is **three jumps, six steep lips**, present in the data, with no
heuristic. The Stepping Stones read `[118 36 36 …]` (a flat stone with a square gap), the
Ski Jump's launch is a `704 → 389` drop mid-section, and the Roller Coaster is a long
continuous `281 → 925` climb. No magnitude rule, no extremum test — the profile *is* the
surface.

This is verified the strict way: `cmd/geomoracle` runs the engine's own `$5FE56`+`$5C0AA`
on the m68k core and the Go reimplementation in `package track` (`railHeight`/
`railProfile`) reproduces every rung of every section of all eight tracks **coordinate-
exact**.

### The plan outline (`$5C6C4`)

The other half of each piece is its **plan footprint** — the `(x,z)` shape of the rung
strip seen from above. The draw loop (`$65CDC`) reads it with `$5C6C4`, which fetches two
consecutive 16-bit little-endian values at byte offset `d2` in the per-type piece-shape
and adds the section base, rotating by quadrant. The vertex pairs are a flat array:

```
plan vertex k = LE16 pair at  a0[0] + 7 + 4k     (even k = left rail, odd = right rail)
                d2 = 2*d1 + $1BB91 ,  $1BB91 = a0[0]+7        (the draw loop's index math)
```

Read out, these are exactly the piece's local outline (`+z` forward, `x` lateral): the
straight piece (`nib 0`) is two parallel rails of width 384 marching `z = 0,256,…,2048`;
the curve pieces (`nib 6`/`7`) are mirror-image arcs; ramps carry their own profiles. The
left/right rails are independent, so the rail **width** (and any asymmetry through a bend)
is exact, not a nominal constant. `cmd/planoracle` drives `$5C6C4` in the canonical frame
(zero base, zero quadrant) and confirms `package track`'s `planProfile` matches it
**exactly** on every vertex of all eight tracks.

## 8. The baked track model (`$65BEC`) — the definitive absolute geometry

The race-setup chain (`$5D2CA`: `$5AE46` load → `$64304` grid → `$5A794` → `$696FC` →
**`$65BEC`**) runs a **bake** that turns the loaded section arrays into the polygon model
everything else draws: per-rung records `{word0, Lx, Lz, Lh, Rx, Rz, Rh}` written to the
buffer at `$7ABDA`, with a per-section index at `$7AA1A`. The per-frame renderer never
recomputes geometry; it re-places these baked records each frame. Annotated flow:

```
$65BEC  bake entry: $65DEA (per-section LOD bytes -> $65E70), record ptr $66102=$7ABDA
$65C0E  per section: $7AA1A[sec] = record ptr; $66100 = 0
$65C2E  $5C51A advance + $5FE56 = peek the NEXT section: if its piece header flags
        ($1BB4D = a0[1]) bit7: $66100 = $4000; and if ($1BC44^$1BC32) bit7: = $8000
$65C66  $5C538 retreat + $5FE56 = set up the CURRENT section; $1BC26 = 0
$65C7A  $1BBF2 = -$1BC4A (NEG.b)      ; section quadrant in a FIXED world frame
$65C8A  $65756: fill the height strip $1BE70 (left/right full-precision rail heights,
        profile entry + $1C650/$1C718 base — no >>5) and the vertex-flag strip $1BDD0:
        a bit-7 marker on a profile byte CLEARS the flag = "this rung is a polygon
        edge"; unmarked rungs keep the $80 the previous emit left = skipped; the last
        rung is preset (1 = finish line when sec == $1CA1C); |dh| >= $280 vs the
        previous rung sets the $20 crease bit; a bit-7 marker after the LAST entry
        hides the last rung entirely (gap pieces — the Stepping Stones edges)
$65CBC  $1BB91 = a0[0]+7 (vertex 0's byte offset), + (cnt-1)*4 when the piece is
        REVERSED (type&$10, $1BC32): reversed pieces run their shape backwards, which
        also swaps the left/right rails
$65CDC  emit loop over d1 = 0,4,..,2*cnt: skip flagged ($80) rungs and d1 < 4 (rung 0
        is the previous section's last rung); emit when d1 >= $1BB5A (the last rung, or
        last-1 when the last is gap-hidden), the piece is a type-2 ramp ($1BB4D bit7),
        p2 == $25 && d1 == $18 (one piece's quirk), or the height second-difference
        |h[d1]/2 - (h[d1-4]+h[d1+4])/4| >= $50 (this is what keeps a rung on a lip);
        record word0 = (flag&$3F)<<8 | $66100 | sec, then for L (d1) and R (d1+2):
        d2 = $1BB91 +- 2*d1, JSR $5C6C4, write $1BBF6, $1BBF8, height $1BE70[d1]
```

`$5C6C4` itself (traced in full) reads one vertex per call — an LE16 `(u,v)` pair at
offset `d2` in the piece-shape — and writes the **absolute plan point** `$1BBF6/$1BBF8 =
base($1BB22/$1BB26) + rot(u,v)`, where the rotation by the quadrant byte `$1BBF2` is one
of exactly four cases (`$800` = one grid cell):

```
q0 (00): X = bx + u          Z = by + v
q1 (01): X = bx + $800 - v   Z = by + u
q2 (10): X = bx + $800 - u   Z = by + $800 - v
q3 (11): X = bx + v          Z = by + $800 - u
```

In the bake the base is **zero** (the init chain leaves `$1BB22/$1BB26 = 0`, checked in
the oracle), so the records are **cell-local** coordinates in `[0,$800]`. The per-frame
draw (`$65EC4`) proves the placement convention: per visible section it calls `$5FF94`
(section cell − camera cell, rotated by the *camera* quadrant), scales the delta by one
cell (`<<10` at half resolution), applies the same four reflections (`$800 − stored`) to
the stored local values, and adds. So the absolute plan position of every vertex is

```
world = gridCell(p1) * $800  +  baked local vertex
```

— no accumulation, no fitting, no spline. The curves join the straights exactly because
each piece's arc *ends where the data says the next cell begins*.

**Reimplementation and proof.** `track.Bake` (`extract/track/model.go`) reproduces the
whole bake in pure Go from the disk image — flag strip, height strip, decimation,
reversed pieces, gap hiding, record words. `cmd/modeloracle` runs the engine's real
init chain + `$65BEC` on the m68k core and compares **every record of every section of
all eight tracks byte-exact** (51/69/54/51/44/82/59/78 records) — OK on all eight.
`track.Geometry` then emits every rung (the decimated ones flagged as the game's drawn
edges) in absolute coordinates; section joints are continuous to within 4 units out of
2048 per cell (the residue is in the game's own shape tables, not the decode), and every
circuit closes. `cmd/modelsvg` renders the top-down plans; `cmd/trackjson` exports
`rungs[i][k] = [Lx,Lz,Rx,Rz,Lh,Rh,flags]` and the viewer now draws the baked model
directly. **Part IV is complete: footprint, surface, camber
and now the absolute plan are all decoded purely from the disk in Go and verified
byte-exact against the original renderer's own build.**

*Part V — the physics.*

---

# Part V — The physics simulation

*The headline goal — done.* The car is simulated as a sprung rigid body, not a point,
which is what gave the game its reputation: the chassis pitches and rolls on its
suspension, the wheels gain and lose contact over crests and on landings, too hard a
landing damages the car, and airtime/handling depend on speed and the track gradient.
The **entire** per-frame simulation has been reverse-engineered from the 68000 code and
reimplemented in Go (`extract/physics`), **verified coordinate-exact against the original
frame by frame** on the `tools/cpu/m68k` core (`cmd/physverify`): every sub-routine matches on
3000 random states each, and the whole frame matches bit-for-bit over 60 consecutive
frames on three tracks. The reimplementation operates directly on the game's 24-bit memory
image, so it can be checked address-for-address.

### 1. The car state and the frame

One physics frame is `$6185C`, called from the race loop (`$5D42C`) just before the
renderer. The model is **semi-implicit Euler in fixed point** with a `0.93` (`= $EE/256`)
damping factor applied at *both* integration stages — that constant is the drag that keeps
the sim stable. The car-state block lives at `$1BCxx`:

```
position  (16.16)  X $1BCD8   Y/height $1BCDC (clamped <= $3E8)   Z $1BCE0
angles    (16-bit) roll $1BCE4   yaw $1BCE6   pitch $1BCE8
velocity           $1BCEA / $1BCEC / $1BCEE
angular momentum   roll $1BCF0   pitch $1BCF2   yaw $1BCF4   (body frame)
```

Forces are summed in the **body frame**, rotated into the world, and integrated. The frame
pipeline is, in order: build the orientation matrix (`$61368`); compute the wheel contact
offsets (`$618CE`); **sample the track surface** under each wheel (`$5C1D0`); compute the
chassis contact-point heights (`$61B70`); rotate velocity into the body frame (`$6158C`)
and gravity into it (`$615E6`); run the **suspension** (`$61BCC`); and — only when grounded
(`$1BB72`) — the **drive/tyre/steer** block (`$620B8`, `$61012`, `$61618`, `$621F4`,
`$62138`, `$61B26`, `$61672`); then integrate force→velocity (`$61ADC`) and
velocity→position (`$61950`).

### 2. Frame transforms

`$61368` builds the 3×3 chassis orientation matrix at `$1C230` from the three Euler angles
(`$64D08` = sin, `$64D10` = cos, via a quarter-wave table at `$1CA42`): it seeds the slots
with sin/cos of each angle, cascades the `MULS/SWAP` products into the composite rotation,
and forms the cross terms. Everything is then shuttled through it: world velocity → body
(`$6158C`), body force → world (`$61618`), body torque → world angular rate (`$61672`), all
driven by a small index table at `$1EC46` that selects which matrix slot each term uses.
**Gravity** enters via `$615E6`: a fixed world-down vector (magnitude `$13D` = 317) is
re-expressed in the tilted body frame each tick, so it always pulls world-down whatever the
car's attitude.

### 3. The suspension — and the surface

The car has a **three-point suspension** (`$61BCC`). Each point computes a spring
compression

```
compression = trackSurfaceY - chassisContactY - restLength      (clamped to [-$300, $1400])
force       = compression + 1.078 * (compression - prevCompression)   ($6180E: spring + damper)
```

The chassis contact heights (`$1BC94/98/9C`) come from the car height tilted by sin(roll)
and sin(pitch) (`$61B70`). The track surface heights (`$1BCA4/A8/AC`) are the **direct
coupling to Part IV**: `$5C1D0` locates the car's section, computes where each wheel sits
across the rung strip, samples the four surrounding rung-corner heights with the *same*
`$5C0AA` builder that produces the rail heights in Part IV, and bilinearly interpolates them
(`$5C554`) — so the springs ride the exact decoded track surface, and a wheel running off
the lateral edge (`$1BB65`) is detected and tapered (`$5C808`).

The three spring forces combine (`$61F42`) into a **net lift** (`$1BD38`, the average), a
**roll torque** (`3 * (left - right)`, clamped) and a **pitch torque** (front − rear); the
**on-ground flag** `$1BB7E` is set if any spring is engaged. The net lift is projected onto
the body axes by the road slope (`$622DC`) into the tyre **loads** `$1BD40/42/44`.

**Damage.** When a spring force exceeds a tolerance (`$1BB01 << 8 + $700`) and stays there
for `$63CE2` frames, damage accumulates into `$1BB4F/50/51` (0–255), with a separate
bottoming counter (`$1BB7D`) for hard slams — the "land too hard and you wreck the car"
mechanic, reproduced exactly.

### 4. Drive, grip and steering

The longitudinal drive force (`$620B8`) comes from the throttle/gear, decays on wheelspin,
and is clamped to the available **grip** (`$621DA`): grip = tyre-load × 2 *only when
grounded* — zero in the air, and load-sensitive on the ground. The lateral tyre force
(`$6217A`) is likewise grip-limited, setting a slide flag (`$1BBC1`) when the demand
exceeds grip — a friction-circle model. A velocity **drag** (`$621F4`) opposes motion:
stiff when grounded and gripping, speed-proportional over a deadzone when rolling free.

`$61012` is the **track-following auto-steer**: it measures the car's heading error against
the section's centreline and nudges the heading (`$1BCE6`) to follow the track, then
computes a pitch-stabilisation torque (`$1BCFE`).

### 5. A copy-protection trap inside the physics

`$61012` carries a piece of the disk **copy protection**. At `$611E8` it compares
`mem[$64AEC]` against a constant and, on mismatch, **zeroes the pitch-stabilisation
torque** — subtly degrading the handling. Both operands are obfuscated specifically so they
can't be grepped: the address is built as `$79360 - $14874`, the magic value as
`$667B379F + $36729563 = $9CEDCD02`. The value at `$64AEC` is not a settings byte — it is
written (at `$5CEFA`) by a routine (`$5CEB4`) that reads the **physical disk hardware**
(CIA-B `$BFD100` drive control, `DMACONR`/`DMACON` disk DMA), i.e. it is derived from the
disk's protection tracks. So on a genuine disk the protection writes `$9CEDCD02` and the
check passes; the extracted blob holds the unpatched `$2F76EA80`, so it fails. The
reimplementation reproduces the check exactly (matching the oracle on the same image); for
a playable sim, "inserting the genuine disk" is just storing the expected value at `$64AEC`.

### 6. Verification

`cmd/physverify` runs each engine routine and its Go twin from identical random snapshots
and compares the state — `Sin/Cos`, the integrator, the matrix and transforms, the
suspension and damage, the drive/tyre/drag, the load projection, the per-section setup, the
**surface sample over loaded tracks**, the auto-steer (both protection branches), and
finally the whole `$6185C` frame in lockstep for 60 frames. **All match exactly.** The
checks pin several subtle behaviours of the original code: a swapped sin/cos
quarter-mirror, a signed `CMPI.b #5` whose `NEG.b $80` stays `$80`, an unsigned shift on
a negative handle that affects only curve pieces, and a branch where a large heading
error uses the *excess* as the correction.

**Part V is complete: the full rigid-body car physics is decoded from the disk in Go and
verified coordinate-exact against the original, frame by frame.** Combined with Part IV, a
car can now be driven over the decoded tracks.

### 7. The render coupling — placing the car on the track

The `$6185C` frame is exact, but it is only half of what makes the car drive. The other
half lives in the engine's **render pass**: each frame, before the physics runs, the game
recomputes *where the car sits on the track* — the section it is over, the surface height
under each wheel, and the heading the orientation matrix is measured against. The physics
reads that coupling state (`$1BC5E`, `$1BB10`, `$1BD5A`, the section `$1BB1C`) and the
suspension samples the surface there. Run the physics *without* the coupling and the car
floats in a mismatched frame and tumbles — which is exactly what a standalone port does.

Mapping the coupling turned up several concrete facts:

- **The per-frame loop is `$5D402` → `$5D608` (a `JMP` back to the top).** Its body runs the
  coupling, the player controls, and **two** `$6185C` ticks (player car and opponent), then
  the lap timer and the 3-D draw. Two physics ticks per displayed frame — consistent with the
  fixed 50 Hz (PAL VBlank) timestep noted earlier.
- **Placement uses a local coordinate frame, not world coordinates.** `$605B6` seats the car
  at `grid×128 + 64` in X/Z, runs the coupling (`$60190` camera/projection, `$5BE44`, `$60246`)
  and one physics tick, then *forces* `posY` to **`$10` = 16.0**. So the car rests at a height
  of ~16 in a frame whose surface sits near zero — it does **not** live at the world height
  (~1000) the standalone sim drifts to. That mismatch was the "flies up at the start" symptom.
- **The controls are a decoded joystick byte at `$1BB47`** (`$5D8A2`): bits 0–1 throttle/brake
  (up/down), bits 2–3 steer (left/right), bit 4 fire — not raw hardware, so a port can inject
  it directly.

Getting this to *execute* on the m68k oracle (so it can be ground truth, per the
[reimplement rule](#)) needed two additions to the shared core, both independently useful and
regression-clean against `physverify`:

- **`ORI`/`ANDI`/`EORI` to `CCR`/`SR`** — the render hit `ORI #$1,CCR` and the core had been
  treating the special `$3C`/`$7C` effective-address field as an immediate destination.
- **`ABCD`/`SBCD`** — the lap timer keeps its score in packed BCD.

With those in place the **coupling routines run to completion on the oracle**, and running
them around a placed car reproduces a grounded, upright, stable equilibrium — the physics no
longer tumbles. What does **not** run in software is the *drawing*: the per-frame 3-D render
(`$66xxx`–`$69xxx`) walks the whole visible scene and, without the Amiga's blitter/copper and
a vertical-blank interrupt, never terminates. So the faithful path is **not** to run the whole
loop, but to reimplement the handful of coupling routines (`$5BE44`, `$60190`, the section
update, the `$1BB47` control decode) in Go — each verifiable in isolation against the now-working
oracle — and compose them around the verified `$6185C` frame. That is the remaining work for a
fully faithful in-browser drive; until it lands, the viewer uses a provisional coupling
(flat ground under the wheels, attitude held) with the **exact** throttle/grip/drag dynamics.

Dynamic verification uses the instruction-level 68000 core in `tools/cpu/m68k`
(`m68k.CPU` over a `Bus`).
