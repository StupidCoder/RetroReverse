# RetroReverse

Are the latest LLMs smart enough to reverse engineer old
software purely by static analysis, without access to a 3rd party debugger? This
repository contains the results of a few tests, attempting to answer that
question. All code and documents contained within (except this introduction) were
written by Claude Fable 5 or Opus 4.8. In some cases my Fable session got flagged, probably due to the nature of reverse engineering, and downgraded to Opus. Opus still did a fine job though.

Even though I explicitly restricted internet searches (released source code or other reverse engineering projects) Claude had detailed knowledge if the games I've had it analyze so far. When I asked how it knew exact function names for Elite it admitted that the original source code of the game, which has been publically released years ago, was part of its training data. The same is true for character and level names of Fort Apocalypse, for example.

Some of the prompts I used (for reference):

> Write a GoLang application that extracts program files from a C64 tape image
> in TAP format. The image in question might use a non-standard fastloader,
> that you need to reverse engineer by disassembling the loader. Use only
> static analysis of the image file without looking up external sources or
> external tools like Vice. Ignore memories from previous reverse engineering
> sessions. Document your findings about the tape image format in general and
> the fastloader in particular in a markdown file. Use example byte sequences
> in that documentation where appropriate. The tape image file in question is
> <GAME.TAP> in the current folder.

> Now that the program has been extracted from the tape, I want to enhance the scope of the project. Using the disassembler you already wrote, analyze the extracted program's startup and document your findings in a markdown file, again using assembly snippets or byte sequences as example where appropriate.

> Next, analyze the actual game code in the same way, again producing a markdown file that describes the initialization of the game until it reaches the main game loop. Put extra focus on the graphical elements like character sets, sprite data and level map. Describe compression or encryption schemes you find and build a memory map.

> Analyze the game code and describe the different types of objects (player, enemies, obstacles) in the game and how they behave in a markdown file. Be as detailed as possible about each object's behavior, movement patterns and collision behaviors.

To do:
* Elite (C64)
    * Part IV
        * List all strings, including missiong briefings
        * Try to reproduce exact system naming of initial galaxy (Diso, Leesti, Lave, etc.)
* Fort Apocalypse (C64)
    * Run new disassembler and add known annotations
    * Part IV
        * Visualize radar map and objects (tank, SPM, etc.)
* Marble Madness (Amiga)
    * Kick off project by writing ADF extractor, disassembler and emulator for 86k code
* Turrican (Amiga)
    * Parts I-II done: custom non-DOS boot disk; TRSI crack loader; the `$50008`
      decruncher reverse-engineered and reimplemented in pure Go
      (`extract/decrunch`, a 3-pass Huffman→LZ77→RLE decoder) — output verified
      byte-identical against the FS-UAE oracle. Next (Part III): disassemble and
      annotate the decrunched game (`$43880` base, `$5F500` entry) into a
      `disasm/` store, per the Marble Madness convention
* Stunt Car Racer (Amiga)
    * Part I recon done: custom (non-AmigaDOS) disk; `DOS\0` boot block bootstraps
      a `$9800`-byte loader read from disk offset `$2C00`. Next (Part II):
      disassemble that loader and map the disk. Goal: extract and replicate the
      vector race tracks (Part IV) and the rigid-body car physics (Part V)
* Super Mario Land (GB)
    * Part I done: a clean 64 KB MBC1 cartridge (4×16 KB banks), header + both
      checksums + Nintendo logo all verified, memory map and CPU vectors decoded.
      Key finding: the Game Boy CPU is the **Sharp LR35902**, not a Z80, so the
      shared `tools/z80` does not apply. Full Game Boy toolchain built and verified:
      `tools/sm83` (disassembler + CPU core), `cmd/dissm83`, `cmd/codetracesm83`, and
      the `tools/gameboy` machine-model oracle (boots SML, populates VRAM). Part II
      done: cold-start at `$0185` (hardware/LCD/sound init, RAM clear, HRAM OAM-DMA
      routine, bank shadows), the VBlank/STAT/timer handlers, and the VBlank-synced
      main loop `$0226→$0296`. Part III done: the engine is a frame-synced state
      machine — `RST $28` over `$FFB3` through a 62-entry table at `$02A6`; oracle-traced
      state flow (boot→title `$0F`→play `$00`); input `$FF80`/`$FF81`; the VBlank render
      chain; the bank-shadow (`$FFFD`/`$C0A4`) convention. Part IV done: the DMG graphics
      formats (2bpp tiles, `$9800`/`$9C00` maps + signed `$8800` addressing, OAM sprites,
      `BGP`/`OBP` palettes) — decoders in `tools/gameboy/gb.go`, verified by rendering the
      title screen and level 1-1 straight from the oracle's VRAM (`extract/cmd/render`).
      **Level maps DONE** (`extract/level` reimplements the `$218F` decoder): screen-order
      table `$4000[ffe4]` → 20-column RLE screens (main path from screen 3; screens 1/2 =
      bonus rooms). The level-id→ffe4→bank chain is traced from the ROM (`$0470`/`$0D64`),
      so `DecodeLevelByID` decodes all 12 levels; each renders in its own world's tiles
      (`extract/cmd/levelmap -id NN`, rendered/ has all 12). Verified column-exact vs the
      oracle. Next: bonus rooms + object/enemy spawn lists (bank-3 tables) and Part V
* Mario Kart DS (DS)
    * First **Nintendo DS** / **ARM** project. Toolchain built: `tools/arm` (ARMv5TE +
      ARMv4T disassembler + CPU core, ARM + Thumb, interworking-aware), `cmd/disarm`,
      `cmd/codetracearm`, and `tools/nds` (cartridge reader — header + FNT/FAT filesystem
      + overlays) with `cmd/ndsinfo`. Part I done: the `.nds` container mapped — 32 MB
      image, header + logo/header CRCs verified, dual-CPU load map (ARM9 `$02000000`,
      ARM7 `$02380000`), 4 ARM9 overlays, and the 606-file FNT/FAT catalog (`data/Course`
      tracks, NITRO `nsbmd`/`nsbtx` assets, LZ77-wrapped `NARC` archives). Next (Part II):
      extract the ARM9/ARM7 binaries and trace the boot chain with `codetracearm`
* Tools
    * Disassembler should be better at segmenting functions; currently jumps within a function are treated as separate sub-routines; try to document parameters of sub-routines (which registers are used?)

## Methodology

[`ANALYSIS-PLAYBOOK.md`](ANALYSIS-PLAYBOOK.md) is a field guide to *how* these
projects were reverse-engineered — the common five-part arc, the reusable
toolkit, the end-to-end flows for C64 tape games and Amiga disk games, the
cross-cutting techniques (entropy triage, known-plaintext attacks, using a
self-built CPU core as an oracle), and a checklist for tackling a new unknown
image. Read it first if you're starting a new game or picking up an existing one.

## Repository structure

Each game lives in its own `<Game> (<Platform>)/` folder following a common
contract, and the reusable building blocks live in a shared `tools` module at
the root. Platform-neutral tools sit directly under `tools/`; platform-specific
ones live in a per-platform subfolder (`tools/c64/` today; `tools/amiga/`,
`tools/snes/`, … as other games are added). A `go.work` ties the modules
together.

Per-game folder contract: `<Game>.<ext>` raw image, a markdown writeup of the
format and/or game internals, an `extract/` Go module that produces the
program files, and `extracted/` / `rendered/` output directories. The
extraction tool is always named `extract` (not tied to tape — a future game
could be disk- or cartridge-based, while the per-game tool keeps the same
name).

## Image files

Many differing dumps of these games circulate online. All results in this
repository were produced from these exact image files; the documentation and
the golden extraction tests assume them byte for byte. The MD5 (and size)
below pin the precise copy, so the work stays reproducible.

(`md5sum` on Linux).

## Shared tools (`tools`)

Platform-neutral packages sit at the top level; platform-specific ones live in a
per-platform subfolder (`c64/`, `amiga/`, …).

| Package / command | What it does |
|-------------------|--------------|
| `mos6502` | One opcode table driving both a `Disassemble` function and an executable `CPU` core (all documented opcodes, binary + BCD) — usable by any 6502 platform. |
| `m68k` | Motorola 68000 toolkit mirroring `mos6502`: a `Decode`/`Disassemble` disassembler (full documented instruction set, all addressing modes) **and** an instruction-level `CPU` execution core over the same `Bus`/`Step()` interface. The core currently runs a minimal-but-correct opcode subset (MOVE/ALU/shift/branch/jump/DBcc/MOVEM/LINK with proper X/N/Z/V/C flags) and halts on anything not yet implemented, so gaps are explicit. Usable by any 68k platform (Amiga, ST, Genesis, …). |
| `z80` | Zilog Z80 toolkit mirroring `mos6502`/`m68k`: a `Decode`/`Disassemble` disassembler over the CPU's x/y/z/p/q opcode bit-fields (all `CB`/`ED`/`DD`/`FD` prefix pages, including `DDCB` and the undocumented `IXH`/`IXL`/`SLL`) **and** a practically complete instruction-level `CPU` execution core (block moves, IM-1 interrupts, documented flags) over the same `Bus`/`Step()` interface. Usable by any Z80 platform (Game Gear, Master System, ZX, MSX, …). |
| `sm83` | Sharp **LR35902** (Game Boy CPU; "GBZ80"/SM83) toolkit: a `Decode`/`Disassemble` disassembler **and** an instruction-level `CPU` execution core over a `Bus`, with `Step` returning T-cycles for the machine to drive timing. A Z80 relative but **not** a Z80, so it is its own package: only four flags (Z/N/H/C), no `IX`/`IY` or `DD`/`FD`/`ED` prefixes (only `CB`), no `IN`/`OUT` (the Game-Boy-only `LDH ($FF00+n)`/`(C)` high-page ops instead), the `LD (HL±)` auto-inc/dec loads, `LD ($nnnn),SP`, `ADD SP,e`, `LD HL,SP+e`, `RETI`, `STOP`, CB-page `SWAP`, and eleven illegal opcodes. Same `Flow`/`Inst` interface as `z80`. Unit-tested (flags, GB ops, interrupts) and verified end-to-end booting Super Mario Land. |
| `arm` | **ARM** toolkit for the two Nintendo DS CPUs — the ARM9 (ARM946E-S, ARMv5TE) and ARM7 (ARM7TDMI, ARMv4T): a `Decode`/`Disassemble` disassembler **and** an instruction-level `CPU` execution core over a `Bus`. It handles **both** of the DS's instruction sets — 32-bit ARM (conditional execution on every instruction, the barrel-shifter operand, multiply/long-multiply, LDR/STR/LDM/STM, the ARMv5 `BLX`/`CLZ`/`BKPT`, saturating `QADD…` and signed `SMLA…` DSP ops) and 16-bit `Thumb` — and the `BX`/`BLX` interworking between them, tracked per address (`Inst.Thumb`/`TargetThumb`). The core models the CPSR flags, banked register file and mode switching (SWI/IRQ via caller hooks; CP15 routed to a `Coproc` hook), and halts on anything unmodelled so gaps are explicit; caches, the MPU, cycle-accurate timing and the 2D/3D video hardware are the caller's "full machine" to layer on top. Adds an eighth `Flow` category, `FlowIndCall`, for ARM's return-after indirect calls. Unit-tested (decode + execution, incl. ARM↔Thumb interworking). |
| `cmd/dis6502` | Linear disassembler for a `.prg` file (2-byte load address + data), optionally over an address range. |
| `cmd/dis68k` | Linear disassembler for a raw 68000 code blob loaded at a given base address (`-skip` steps past an AmigaDOS hunk header). |
| `cmd/codetrace6502` | Recursive-descent 6502 disassembler: from given entry points (and seeded jump tables) it follows every branch/jump/call, marks reachable code vs data, lists routines and unresolved indirect jumps — so tables and graphics aren't mis-decoded as instructions. |
| `cmd/codetrace68k` | The 68000 counterpart of `codetrace6502`, built on `m68k`: same recursive trace over a raw blob loaded at `-base` (`-skip` past a hunk header), reporting routines and unresolved register/indexed jumps. |
| `cmd/disz80` | Linear disassembler for a raw Z80 code slice mapped at a given address (`-off`/`-len`/`-base`). |
| `cmd/dissm83` | Linear disassembler for a Game Boy ROM, built on `sm83`: a flat file slice (`-off`/`-len`/`-base`) or an MBC1 bank view (`-bank N -start A -end A`, with bank 0 fixed at `$0000`–`$3FFF` and bank *N* in `$4000`–`$7FFF`). |
| `cmd/codetracesm83` | The Game Boy counterpart of `codetracez80`, built on `sm83`: recursive trace from given entry points over a 32 KB bank view (`-bank N`; bank 0 fixed, bank *N* in `$4000`–`$7FFF`), with `-table` jump-table seeding and an `-annotate` file for naming routines. |
| `cmd/codetracez80` | The Z80 counterpart of `codetrace6502`, built on `z80`: recursive trace from given entry points over a banked ROM (`-load` selects the resident bank), with an `-annotate` file for naming routines. |
| `cmd/disarm` | Linear disassembler for a raw ARM/Thumb blob mapped at a given address (`-off`/`-len`/`-base`, `-thumb` selects Thumb), built on `arm`. |
| `cmd/codetracearm` | The ARM counterpart of `codetrace68k`, built on `arm`: recursive trace from given entry points over a flat image (`-base`/`-skip`), tracking ARM/Thumb state through `BX`/`BLX` interworking (entries suffixed `t`/`a`, or bit 0 of a pointer, select the state). `-table` seeds pointer tables and `-annotate` names routines; reports routines and unresolved indirect transfers. |
| `c64/tap` | Parse a TAP v0/v1 image (C64/C16) into a pulse stream; `Segmentize` splits it at pauses. |
| `c64/cbmtape` | Decode the standard Commodore KERNAL (ROM loader) tape encoding: blocks, headers, and paired header+data files with checksum verification. |
| `c64/c64` | A minimal C64 machine model — RAM, the `mos6502` CPU, a CIA pulse-feed tape model, a PC-hook registry, a RAM write log and an optional read probe — for *running* a self-modifying loader instead of decoding it, or tracing which game routine touches which memory. Optional standard KERNAL tape hooks included. |
| `c64/gfx` | C64/VIC rendering (palette, multicolor characters, hires sprites, multicolor bitmaps) plus general 2-D helpers (line drawing, markers, still/animated PNG output). |
| `c64/cmd/tapdump` | Print a pulse-width histogram and the pause-delimited segment map of a `.tap` — the usual first look at an unknown tape. |
| `amiga/adf` | Read a standard AmigaDOS floppy image (ADF): detect OFS/FFS, walk the directory tree, and extract file contents (handles hash chains, OFS data-block headers and multi-block file-extension chains). |
| `amiga/cmd/adfdump` | List an `.adf`'s volume, directory tree and file sizes; `-x outdir` extracts every file preserving the directory structure. |
| `amiga/hunk` | Load an AmigaDOS hunk object/executable: place its CODE/DATA/BSS segments from a base, apply the 32-bit relocations, and return a flat image (and each segment's base) ready to disassemble. |
| `amiga/cmd/hunkload` | Print a hunk file's segment map; `-o` writes its flat relocated image and `-syms` writes its symbol table as a `codetrace68k` annotations file. |
| `amiga/iff` | Decode an IFF `FORM…ILBM` bitmap (planar BODY, ByteRun1/uncompressed, CMAP palette) into a Go image. |
| `amiga/icon` | Decode a Workbench `.info` icon (DiskObject + planar Image structs) into images, using the standard Workbench palette. |
| `amiga/cmd/amigapng` | Render an IFF ILBM or a `.info` icon to PNG (auto-detects the format). |
| `amiga/powerpacker` | Decompress PowerPacker (`PP20`) data — one of the most common Amiga crunchers (games, demos, intros). Faithful reimplementation of the standard backward bit-reader decode loop. |
| `amiga/cmd/ppdecrunch` | Decompress a `PP20` file, or a `PP20` block embedded at a `-off`/`-len` slice of a larger file. |
| `gamegear/gamegear` | Sega Game Gear VDP graphics: the 4-bitplane tile, 12-bit CRAM palette and name-table decoders, plus a minimal `Machine` (8 KB RAM + Sega cartridge mapper + VDP ports) that drives the `z80` core as an *emulation oracle* — run a real ROM, then read back VRAM/CRAM to compose the exact screen the code drew. Usable by any Game Gear (and, for the tiles, Master System) game. |
| `gameboy` | Game Boy (DMG) machine model driving the `sm83` core as an *emulation oracle*: the MBC1 mapper, the full memory map (VRAM/WRAM/OAM/HRAM/IO), and the timer and LCD scanline counter with their VBlank/STAT/timer interrupts — enough to run a real ROM through its boot and per-frame loop, then read back VRAM/OAM (`RunFrame`/`RunFrames`, plus a PC histogram and a VRAM write-watch). Also the fixed DMG **graphics decoders** (`gb.go`): the 2bpp tile, the `BGP`/`OBP` palette registers, tile-sheet and 32×32 background-map composition (`$8000`/signed-`$8800` addressing), and an OAM/sprite screen compositor (`RenderScreen`). Usable by any Game Boy game; MBC1 today. |
| `nds` | Nintendo DS cartridge (`.nds`) container reader: the ROM header (with CRC-16 verification), the ARM9/ARM7 binaries and their overlay tables, and the on-cartridge filesystem — the **FAT** (flat start/end offset table) joined to the **FNT** directory tree to resolve every file's full path and ID. The DS counterpart of `amiga/adf`; makes no assumptions about the game inside. Usable by any DS title. |
| `nds/cmd/ndsinfo` | DS container inspector built on `nds`: prints the header, integrity checks (header/logo CRC), the ARM9/ARM7/overlay layout and the filesystem catalog (`-files` lists every file's ID/range/size/path, `-tree` groups by directory, `-grep` filters). |

## Building and running

The `go.work` workspace lets the game tools resolve the local `tools`
module. Build and test each module from its own directory:

```sh
( cd tools && go test ./... )
( cd "Elite (C64)/extract" && go test ./... )
( cd "Fort Apocalypse (C64)/extract" && go test ./... )
```

(The integration tests skip automatically when the `.tap` image is absent.)
The shared module's import path is `retroreverse.com/tools`, so its commands
are run by that full path from anywhere in the workspace (the `go.work` is
found by walking up from the current directory), e.g.
`go run retroreverse.com/tools/c64/cmd/tapdump ...`.

`tapdump` is generic — point it at any C64 `.tap` to see its pulse encoding
and segment layout (the first step when approaching an unfamiliar tape):

```sh
go run retroreverse.com/tools/c64/cmd/tapdump path/to/any.tap
```

`adfdump` is likewise generic for Amiga disks — it lists and extracts the files
of any standard AmigaDOS floppy image:

```sh
go run retroreverse.com/tools/amiga/cmd/adfdump path/to/disk.adf            # list
go run retroreverse.com/tools/amiga/cmd/adfdump -x out path/to/disk.adf     # extract
```

The `extract` tools are not generic: each one is written for its game's
specific loader, so it only runs on that game's image. Run a game's extractor
from its own folder:

```sh
cd "Elite (C64)/extract" && go build && ./extract -o ../extracted ../Elite.tap

cd "Fort Apocalypse (C64)/extract" && go build && \
    ./extract -o ../extracted -dis ../Fort_Apocalypse.tap
```

Extracting a *new* game means writing a new per-game `extract` tool on top of
`tools` (see "Two extraction strategies" below), not reusing one of these.

Disassemble any extracted file with the shared tools — `dis6502` for 6502,
`dis68k` for 68000 (`-skip` steps past an Amiga hunk header):

```sh
go run retroreverse.com/tools/cmd/dis6502 -start 8927 -end 8A40 \
    "Fort Apocalypse (C64)/extracted/FORT-fast-7000.prg"

go run retroreverse.com/tools/cmd/dis68k -skip 36 amiga-code-hunk.bin
```

## Two extraction strategies

The two tapes need fundamentally different approaches, and the shared tools
support both:

- **Declarative decoding** (Fort Apocalypse). The fastloader is static: a
  fixed Novaload-family format with page records and checksums. The extractor
  reimplements that format on top of `tap` + `cbmtape` and reads the payload
  straight off the pulse stream.

- **Run-the-loader emulation** (Elite). The fastloader rewrites its own wire
  format on the fly — bit order, bits-per-byte, header size and sync handling
  all change mid-load, driven by patch blocks that arrive on the tape itself.
  Reimplementing the protocol is hopeless, so the extractor *runs the actual
  loader* on the `c64/c64` + `mos6502` machine model, feeding it the tape
  pulses and logging every memory write the loader performs.

For a new C64 tape the workflow is: `tapdump` to see the encoding, `cbmtape`
to read the boot file, `dis6502` to disassemble the loader, then choose a
strategy — a static loader is a new decoder package; a hostile self-modifying
one is a set of hooks on the `c64/c64` machine model.
