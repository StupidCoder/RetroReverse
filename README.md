# AI Reverse Engineering

Are the latest LLMs smart enough to reverse engineer old
software purely by static analysis, without access to a 3rd party debugger? This
repository contains the results of a few tests, attempting to answer that
question. All code and documents contained within (except this introduction) were
written by Claude Fable 5.

Some of the prompts I used (for reference):

> Write a GoLang application that extracts program files from a C64 tape image
> in TAP format. The image in question might use a non-standard fastloader,
> that you need to reverse engineer by disassembling the loader. Use only
> static analysis of the image file without looking up external sources or
> external tools like Vice. Ignore memories from previous reverse engineering
> sessions. Document your findings about the tape image format in general and
> the fastloader in particular in a markdown file. Use example byte sequences
> in that documentation where appropriate. The tape image file in question is
> <GAME.TAP> in the current folder.

> Now that the program has been extracted from the tape, I want to enhance the scope of the project. Using the disassembler you already wrote, analyze the extracted program's startup and document your findings in a markdown file, again using assembly snippets or byte sequences as example where appropriate.

> Next, analyze the actual game code in the same way, again producing a markdown file that describes the initialization of the game until it reaches the main game loop. Put extra focus on the graphical elements like character sets, sprite data and level map. Describe compression or encryption schemes you find and build a memory map.

> Analyze the game code and describe the different types of objects (player, enemies, obstacles) in the game and how they behave in a markdown file. Be as detailed as possible about each object's behavior, movement patterns and collision behaviors.

## Repository structure

Each game lives in its own `<Game> (<Platform>)/` folder following a common
contract, and the reusable C64 building blocks live in a shared `c64tools`
module at the root. A `go.work` ties the modules together.

Per-game folder contract: `<Game>.<ext>` raw image, a markdown writeup of the
format and/or game internals, an `extract/` Go module that produces the
program files, and `extracted/` / `rendered/` output directories. The
extraction tool is always named `extract` (not tied to tape — a future game
could be disk- or cartridge-based, while the per-game tool keeps the same
name).

## Image files

Many differing dumps of these games circulate online. All results in this
repository were produced from these exact image files; the documentation and
the golden extraction tests assume them byte for byte. The MD5 (and size)
below pin the precise copy, so the work stays reproducible.

| Image | Size (bytes) | MD5 |
|-------|-------------:|-----|
| `Elite (C64)/Elite.tap` | 801,592 | `d51b7f84fd1bec6eb24f4bf210c8cc74` |
| `Fort Apocalypse (C64)/Fort_Apocalypse.tap` | 225,817 | `bec7409816865f3ad160af9984f127cd` |

Verify a copy before reusing it, e.g. `md5 "Elite (C64)/Elite.tap"`
(`md5sum` on Linux).

## Shared tools (`c64tools`)

| Package / command | What it does |
|-------------------|--------------|
| `tap` | Parse a TAP v0/v1 image (C64/C16) into a pulse stream; `Segmentize` splits it at pauses. |
| `cbmtape` | Decode the standard Commodore KERNAL (ROM loader) tape encoding: blocks, headers, and paired header+data files with checksum verification. |
| `mos6502` | One opcode table driving both a `Disassemble` function and an executable `CPU` core (all documented opcodes, binary + BCD). |
| `c64` | A minimal C64 machine model — RAM, the `mos6502` CPU, a CIA pulse-feed tape model, a PC-hook registry, a RAM write log and an optional read probe — for *running* a self-modifying loader instead of decoding it, or tracing which game routine touches which memory. Optional standard KERNAL tape hooks included. |
| `gfx` | Generic rendering: the C64 palette, multicolor characters, hires sprites, marker drawing and PNG output. |
| `cmd/disprg` | Disassemble a `.prg` file (2-byte load address + data), optionally over an address range. |
| `cmd/tapdump` | Print a pulse-width histogram and the pause-delimited segment map of a `.tap` — the usual first look at an unknown tape. |

## Building and running

The `go.work` workspace lets the game tools resolve the local `c64tools`
module. Build and test each module from its own directory:

```sh
( cd c64tools && go test ./... )
( cd "Elite (C64)/extract" && go test ./... )
( cd "Fort Apocalypse (C64)/extract" && go test ./... )
```

(The integration tests skip automatically when the `.tap` image is absent.)
The shared module's import path is `stupidcoder.com/c64tools`, so its commands
are run by that full path from anywhere in the workspace (the `go.work` is
found by walking up from the current directory), e.g.
`go run stupidcoder.com/c64tools/cmd/tapdump ...`.

`tapdump` is generic — point it at any C64 `.tap` to see its pulse encoding
and segment layout (the first step when approaching an unfamiliar tape):

```sh
go run stupidcoder.com/c64tools/cmd/tapdump path/to/any.tap
```

The `extract` tools are not generic: each one is written for its game's
specific loader, so it only runs on that game's image. Run a game's extractor
from its own folder:

```sh
cd "Elite (C64)/extract" && go build && ./extract -o ../extracted ../Elite.tap

cd "Fort Apocalypse (C64)/extract" && go build && \
    ./extract -o ../extracted -dis ../Fort_Apocalypse.tap
```

Extracting a *new* game means writing a new per-game `extract` tool on top of
`c64tools` (see "Two extraction strategies" below), not reusing one of these.

Disassemble any extracted file with the shared tool:

```sh
go run stupidcoder.com/c64tools/cmd/disprg -start 8927 -end 8A40 \
    "Fort Apocalypse (C64)/extracted/FORT-fast-7000.prg"
```

## Two extraction strategies

The two tapes need fundamentally different approaches, and the shared tools
support both:

- **Declarative decoding** (Fort Apocalypse). The fastloader is static: a
  fixed Novaload-family format with page records and checksums. The extractor
  reimplements that format on top of `tap` + `cbmtape` and reads the payload
  straight off the pulse stream.

- **Run-the-loader emulation** (Elite). The fastloader rewrites its own wire
  format on the fly — bit order, bits-per-byte, header size and sync handling
  all change mid-load, driven by patch blocks that arrive on the tape itself.
  Reimplementing the protocol is hopeless, so the extractor *runs the actual
  loader* on the `c64/` + `mos6502` machine model, feeding it the tape pulses
  and logging every memory write the loader performs.

For a new C64 tape the workflow is: `tapdump` to see the encoding, `cbmtape`
to read the boot file, `disprg` to disassemble the loader, then choose a
strategy — a static loader is a new decoder package; a hostile self-modifying
one is a set of hooks on the `c64` machine model.
